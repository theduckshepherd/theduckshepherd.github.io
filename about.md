You might have already guessed my name from my webpage URL. This is pretty much just to put down my thoughts (publicly), less I forget it. It does have religious references, so if it offended anybody, I do apologise in advance. Although you could probably tell I'm a Catholic from my introduction page already.

Again, I could also be completely wrong in my analyses. So take everything with a grain of salt. But it's all about having an open discussion to discuss things that we tend to not mention in our life. It is more intriguing than we thought.

In terms of approach, I prefer to maintain objectivity and neutral stance. The English language is best for this because I felt that it is able to approaches neutrality better than other languages, due to just how widespread English is. Language is linked to their culture, and because English is so diverse it is not strictly tied to any particular culture or social norms when read. At least, one does not simply read English and state that it has a particular country's vibe (except for word choice). 

In case that you would like to contact me, maybe you can open an issue on this repository on GitHub. Something like that since I don't like sharing email addresses much. Sorry.

Credit goes to Barry Clark for the template of this webpage, his repository Jekyll Now has been very helpful for someone who is barely able to use Git like me.

### Notes
I was baptised on 15th October 2023, so at the date of writing this, it's been three months. I'm basically a baby Catholic.

Hopefully in 5 or 10 years time I can look back at this and see how much I have grown, provided that I don't lose my email address.
