## A. Introduction on Denying Evil
Perhaps it is in our nature to deny evil, which, is perfectly reasonable in that it is the opposite of God’s nature. It is the root of sins, so to speak, and that also is common knowledge. We can be tempted to sin, which is not always obvious. In denial of sins, we are trying to live more righteously (again, so to speak), closer to God’s ways. In this sense, we can understand denial as a refusal to follow. There’s also nothing wrong with this definition in particular. 

As Father John O’Connor has written in his book (Food for Faith) in section 46 (“Tempted”), temptation involves a lie. And again, in section 52 (“Fear or Love”), “perhaps the devil is delighted when we deny his existence because he is then free to move in the world and in our lives without being recognised and named”.
However, even the [Cambridge dictionary][deny] has at least two different definitions for the word ‘deny’ alone. Which is actually interesting.

**A. Verb (NOT TRUE)**: _to say that something is not true._

**B. Verb (REFUSE)**: _to not allow someone to have or do something._

And again, a synonym of ‘deny’ would be to ‘reject’. There’s a line to tread carefully here.
Let’s go with the second definition first. To deny (refuse) evil/sin would be either to not follow the evil way (all good), or it could also imply refusal of one’s sins. Admittedly, at some point in our lives, we believe that what we are doing is right, even though it is wrong. And perhaps because of our stubbornness to refuse sin, we may in fact refuse our own sin and do something wrong in the name of being righteous (that’s a pun).

The first definition, again, is more aligned closely with saying something like, ‘It is not true to say that what I did was sinful’. Again, by denying sin, (sometimes) we accidentally invited ourselves to sin more. And the devil is probably delighted to see that.

Back to temptation itself, temptation always involves a lie. Something that falls short of its promise (Fr. John O’Connor mentioned this). Maybe we could be tempted to lie to ourselves that our actions were not sinful. So, in a way, the devil is pretty smart in using our desire to do good against us. Quite a clever one.

Therefore, perhaps it is not wise to deny the existence of the devil, because it makes us less aware of it. In fact, it’s better to say that we acknowledge that the devil exists, or, in a slightly more controversial way of speaking, we believe that the devil exists. Being aware of the devil should also help us in being aware that God is with us (Yay).

Note that in the word ‘devil’, I’m alluding to sins or evil in general.

It is easy to say that we do not want to sin because of course we do not want to sin. But to sin is an action in itself, so it should be a matter of acknowledging that we could sin and, in our humility, ask for forgiveness.

### A.1. Side Notes - On Forgiveness and Guilt
On a second note, guilt itself is also a dangerous thing. Predominantly good to bring people toward repentance, it is too often used as a tool to be in control over someone, unintentionally or intentionally. I believe God is not exactly in control of us.

To paraphrase a friend of mine who is a priest, the Sacrament of Reconciliation is about God giving you a hug and saying that he forgives us and loves us regardless, not about condemning us or guilt-tripping us.

From my perspective, it is a humble acknowledgement of our mistakes. There’s something very beautiful about genuflecting in church in general, in my honest opinion.

## B. Synonymously, on Rejecting Sins
A synonym of ‘deny’ is rejected. Perhaps it is actually way too easy to swing between refusing or rejecting. Rejection, therefore, is a form of denial.
Think about it, we refuse to sin, to the best of our abilities. So, it could be said to be synonymous with rejecting sins altogether. 

However, do we reject sins or the persons that sinned?

This is probably a question about our object of rejection. Temptation involves a lie. So in a way, we could be tempted to lie to ourselves that the other person is fully bad, or mostly bad and thus deserves condemnation.

I myself thought about it. When we see that someone sinned, or we know that someone did something terrible, we are likely to think “How could someone like this ever do good?”

Fair enough. However, a person has multiple characteristics. In which a bad one will be more likely to bring about harmful actions, and good ones are more likely to bring about good actions. So, because of certain bad characteristics, we are likely to reject the possibility of them doing well out of their good characteristics. 

In fact, I may more accurately say that sins tend to bring about similar sins that revolve around the same bad characteristics in a person. Which really has nothing to do with their goodness. Because they are separate, that does not stop them from doing good toward someone else.

In rejecting sin, we may be pulled toward rejecting someone altogether. Because we wanted to be on the good side, we refused to side with the bad side. But we probably forget that everyone is brother and sister, and because we were born in the image of God, we also are good in our nature (except we then add sins to ourselves later). Rejecting a person likely leads to dismissal of the person. And God told us to love everyone. So now out of our goodwill, we ended up doing sinful stuff again.

In that isolation and rifts between people, the devil probably will also be glad. Out of the rejection for sins because of our righteousness, we may or may not have isolated someone (whether in our actions or in our hearts), which, again, makes them more susceptible to sin, and it is possibly a sin of our own too. The devil is also clever in this one.

In a way, ‘reject’ is a slightly extreme way of saying refuse. Which is possibly why St. Teresa of Avila spoke of perfection. Nothing too much (one can become extreme), nothing too little (one can distance oneself from God). A fine line of perfection only. In this sense, perfection is more about balance than anything. Being pious and devout is on this line of thought, so to speak, in that we place God in the highest priority in our lives.

On being perfect, it’s not about filling up the bar to be full, it’s also about not overflowing the bar. In fact, sometimes the bar does not need to be full at all but just enough.

For an example, **Psalm 23:1-3** wrote: 
> The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

Surely God didn’t make the field of green pasture lands too big that the sheep get exhausted and die from thirst before they could run for the water stream nearby. God also didn’t flood the streams either and accidentally caused the sheep to drown. God provides abundance, but nothing too extreme.

In fact, ‘extreme’ is probably a word for humanity alone, in that it is interpreted as ‘too much’, or ‘very large’. Although God’s actions may seem extreme in our imperfect eyes, he did so in a righteous manner and thus could not be considered extreme. However, in our human pursuit of perfection, it is possible to stray and be extreme about certain matters. And because God’s path of perfection is so precise the devil is able to take advantage of the gap between our pursuit and the way of perfection (that’s a pun too).

## C. In the Danger of Rejecting Sins
I have times when I think the same. “How can someone do good if they are bad?”

Correction. People are not bad. They DO bad things, but they aren’t bad. They are good. 

Now change the question: “How can someone do good if they do bad actions and they are good by nature?”

Isn’t the answer obvious?

Those who are a little too righteous would quite likely feel righteous in rejecting sins and possibly those who sinned. They may feel that it is part of their responsibility to, in layman's terms, punish or correct those who sinned. 

It is understandable and, in some cases, honourable in that they do not remain passive in the face of evil. However, one does not need to be extreme to stand up for their faith in a reasonable manner. Now, there are a few potential troubles in attempting to punish/correct someone who sinned in the ‘too righteous’ scenarios (case dependent).

-	Imbalance dynamic: It is easy to imagine that to correct someone, one must be better than the punished. However, it is hard to measure who is more correct, because one sins in one way and another sins in another way. Perhaps it’s easier to measure in terms of how strong one’s faith is; however, it is not possible to punish on the virtue of faith alone. Placing oneself on a pedestal to correct or punish someone is an easy step toward arrogance.

-	No rights to do so: As I mentioned before, it’s more or less the Lord who can judge impartially and correctly. We don’t really have any rights here except for voicing our opinions (freedom of speech) and preventing them from doing more wrongs or advising them. For example, if can be done safely, one should try to stop a person from stabbing someone to death)
  
-	We can’t fix others: To correct someone is likely to lead to trying to fix them. And we can’t fix others, so again, it’s still important to know that it is up to the person alone.
  
There’s a reason why in the Sacrament of Reconciliation we are given a penance, not a punishment. By the definition of penance from the [Cambridge dictionary][penance]:

**(Verb)** _an act that shows that you feel sorry about something that you have done, sometimes for religious reasons._

Nowhere does this mention punishment? Additionally, St. Paul’s letter(s) to the Romans (**Romans 8:1**) wrote:
> Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

What we say here, is that in the danger of rejecting sin, out of our goodwill we could end up ‘too righteous’ and attempt to correct or punish someone. And if even the Lord does not condemn those who belong to him, who are we to do so?

And as mentioned before, outright rejection could in fact make us less aware of the devil’s presence. It is easy for anyone to say that mortal sins are never to be committed, but not many can speak of how sneaky it can be in the smallest of our actions despite our good intentions. In fact, I may dare to say that the obviously big and serious sins (according to the majority’s common sense), are mere distractions for the devil’s more sophisticated tricks to evade our detections.

On another hand, Christ himself rejects sinful actions but has never once rejected us sinners ourselves. If the Lord really rejected us sinners, he would not have come to us. He would not have put himself in the human world for us. In that Jesus gave us salvation through his life, death, and resurrection. He (specifically) invites the sinners, as per **Luke 5:32**: 

> I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

And out of personal experiences, I believe rejection of a person, for whatever reasons, likely leads to dehumanisation and condemnation.

## D. Conclusion
Too many problems come from the lack of acknowledgement. This is difficult for me to summarise concisely, however, let me attempt to make a few points clear (in my opinion):

- Instead of denying evil, let us acknowledge its existence, and conversely be aware of the existence of Christ in us. We see the light easier in the dark sky than in the bright daytime (sometimes).

- Refuse the occasions of sins as best as we can, however, outright rejection is too easily confused with denial of sin (in ourselves).

- Because we are not perfect, the extremity is to be carefully treaded to, again, avoid the occasions of sins. 

- In rejecting sins, we are likely to reject the sinners. Let us acknowledge that we are all equal, and welcome others toward repentance, not isolation and dismissal.
