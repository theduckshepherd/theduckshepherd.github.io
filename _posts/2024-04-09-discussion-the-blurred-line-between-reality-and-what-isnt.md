# A. On Perception and Reality
There exists an objective reality that is completely independent of our perception. Our perceptions gave us our very own reality, and it simply is how our brain translate the stimuli that we received from that reality. And therefore, our perceptions are not reality. Let that be the premise.

And yet for myself nothing has ever feel tangible enough. Once the event has passed, it no longer becomes tangible, no longer something I could grasp and perceive as it was originally, ever unchanging. Even if I was to hold an object in my hand and observe my present surroundings, I could almost notice how every passing second would never turn back, and what was tangible no longer is, instead something else is now the new reality. Admittedly I have become less detached over the years, however it never really went away, I think.

Closing my hand, I could feel the fingernails digging into my palm. Once my hand releases itself and the sensations subsidied, that feelings on my skin is no longer tangible. Even if it did hurt, it is also not tangible and can't be experienced again. Worse, even in the face of physical injuries, I could only perceive the pain in its present, and as much as my amazing imagination could recreate that sensation up to 90% in terms of being realistics (and less in intensity since the mind cannot invoke just the same amount of pain compared to that of the actual external stimuli), once the pain subsides, my body somewhat "forget" about it. Not that I forget what happened, but I could not recreate the same sensations again. And indeed if that was possible, then I could only believe that our mind is our greatest tormentor. At that point the mind is everything that our perception is.

The reality is that I felt pain. The perception is that I could no longer feel it the exact same way again, not because I like pain similar to how a masochist does, but because if it cannot be reproduced or recalled similarly then it is meaningless. Reproducibility is a tenet of science experimentation. At that point I realised the difference between our perception and reality. We can no longer reenact reality, and if even our mind could not recall it, then although we know it as a fact that it happened, we could never retrieve that event simply due to the limitations in our perceptions.
