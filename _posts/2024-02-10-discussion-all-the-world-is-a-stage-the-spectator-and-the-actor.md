All the world's a stage. You might have already heard that from one of Shakespeare's works. We are simultaneously the actors of our lives and the spectators of others. Times of reflection, however, are the opportunities for us to step off the stage, detach from our character, and observe our performances.

An actor had the opportunity to observe another character up close and pick up the small details as well as nuances, but sometimes lack the opportunity to see themselves. At the same time, those in the audience seat have the freedom of movement and view angles and thus obtain a better overview.

In other words, sometimes detachment is good.

## A. The Actor
There are many roles that we play throughout our lives, depending on our relationships with others. Regardless of what role it is, there is a certain degree of emotional investment in it, as well as the image that we ought to keep up with different people. Sometimes that image we portray will be closer to who we are, and sometimes it won't be. That is fine, it's a way to maintain social dynamics.

Please note, however, that the below is by no means exhaustive but a few angles from which we can extrapolate on the topic.

### A.1. On the Matter of Emotional Involvement
It is obvious that on the stage we are bound to feel the emotions of the character to some extent, especially the stronger ones. Some people can become absorbed, some can remain level-headed, and in fact, each person may have a different way of reacting to their roles and the emotions their roles experience. 

For many, but perhaps not for myself, emotions play a large factor in driving how a person acts in their performance on the stage. Indeed, if we think of ourselves as a person piloting a shell that is our role, and the damages or joys that the shell registered indeed came to us. Of course different shells, so to speak, give different signals. For example, as a child, it does not hurt as much to be told that one is silly, compared to hearing the same thing in a different role where one was in a position of leadership yet chastised by their boss. The metaphor could be gross, but we can think of our emotional involvements as how much we choose to "fuse" into our shell, or clothes. Those who are a bit more integrated feel it a bit more directly as a comment toward their character, both positive and negative, but this does not account for the self-doubts that are present in our hearts.

But emotions are as fleeting as the wind, they come and go. It is said that the emotions that we experience because of external events only last for a brief period, anything else that comes after is mostly self-inflicted, especially for the more negative ones, where the sources can be rumination, self-criticism, etc. Again the examples here are only for the sake of context.

And yet the emotions we felt so strongly, those that affect not only the shell but the pilot, the driver of actions. As the actor, we may happen to let it take the wheels, and as a result, we may become dependent on it. Indeed, emotions can be very helpful as a primordial tool to direct our next actions. Happiness entices us to pursue similar actions, sadness tells us that something harmed us emotionally, fear warns us to stay away from danger, and so on and so forth.

Yet, when the emotions subside is it possible for one to feel empty and lost? As a person, I was once envious of those who had the emotions to drive their actions and wished to be like them. Unfortunately, not everyone is made the same and no matter what happens, what I felt fled too quickly from the gaps between my fingers. At one point, indeed I did feel that things were empty and miserable.

But what was necessary for the need to be attached to emotions, anyway? Why is it that we seek emotions to direct us, and when we do not have that, we wallow in our loss? Was it ever a loss at all, that we can decide to let go of certain feelings? Indeed by mere invocation, our old feelings can arise. But here is the anguish of confirmation - we aren't the same, and eventually what fits for others does not fit for us. If one cannot act by their emotions, they can act through other means, because no shell fits all. Even the attempt to arrive at a socially acceptable result is enough for commendation, one does not have to reach it by a certain method.

At the very least, I perhaps saw the futility in trying to cling to emotions that should have been let go. Maybe the fact that they slipped through my fingers at every stage was simply the fact that I let them go through, just like how we let the cold water of the river run through our fingers - there is no way to stop it. No river is ever the same. So why are we sad that we cannot grasp the flow of the river, when one knows it is impossible?

We have choices, in the present tense. Choies to cling to the feelings that our shell experienced or the choices to let go, and perhaps there are even more options than that. What is important, is to make sure those emotions do not overstay their welcome. If one were to act as a dam that held all of one's feelings to one side without letting go, despite the continuous flow of the river, the dam would eventually burst. At that point not only such a person will feel a loss to what they held to be a treasure, but perhaps a sense of confusion and lack of direction.

In the psychology area, there is a difference between _self-as-context_ ([Source][self-as-context]), where we observe our thoughts and accept them, rather than _self-as-content_, when what we feel is what we are. Admittedly, one's actions do not determine oneself, but more often than not the line is blurred and thus one- mind should remain lucid and clear at all times. Even though we have no control over the external factors that affect our emotions, we can choose our feelings and reactions. 

To 'collect' so many emotions together with a dam is only a way to muddle it. Feelings should not be mixed over time, for they will be contaminated and spread. Emotions that should have been directed at someone for hurting us, are now spread to others who had no reason to receive them. Feelings of happiness and misery are mixed together, and in that confusion, I dare say that it is hard to find fulfilment.

### A.2. On the Matter of Honour, Honour that Amplified Our Emotions
Honour, pride in our shells. The characters that we played. The roles that we assume as an actor. Honour is the kind where we hold certain values about ourselves that lead to expectations, expectations that ask us to be treated a certain way. I'm only writing in this direction for this is as far as I understood at the time of writing, however, I'm sure Honour had a much bigger space to explore still.

A person may only know their own roles, at least the ones they are aware of, and the ones they know they are supposed to play. However, there is no script for an actor to follow, and no lines to recite. Only a general direction and ad-libs which come about entirely at the actor's wills. Nobody knows each other scripts except for observing the shells they pilot and the way they act in the spotlight. Regardless, we hoped that in the spotlight others would pick up details on our values, our personas, and how we would like to be treated as such.

That being said, we are all in our different roles. And these roles influence how we pick up details. A shell is designed for its own functions, as such it may not work well for other tasks. So, why must we place expectations or have honour if our shells are so incomplete and lacking in knowledge? A just expectation, which in itself is nearly impossible by the definition alone, can only come from a place of complete knowledge of the situation and persons involved. One may expect to be treated a certain way, but expectations relating to honour also place conditional statements on our emotions. If one is given respect, our ego is satisfied. If one is faced with disdainful expressions, one feels hurt and thus our expectations set us up to be upset.

The kind of honour that amplifies our emotions is those with expectations. They do not necessarily come from a place of reasons but for the most part, our own needs. In fact, the kind of honour that lacks expectations but has a sense of good morality is a better option in which one can stand up for oneself in the face of contempt and ill-treatment, without letting ourselves be driven by the shell.

Remember that we are the pilot, and the more we are fused to our shells, the harder it is to detach from the clothes that we wear.

## B. The Spectator
There are two ways in which we can spectate: Through our observation of others' characters, and through the audience seat. However, it is more accurate to say that the audience seat is simply another stage where only the invited can watch. Our personal space.

Those who observe others from the stage see only the faces that others have put into the spotlights, and if by chance, the persons that they are when they slip up. Because we too have our own scripts, so to speak, we can't afford to see others from all angles. And indeed because we are still an actor in our own right on that stage, we can't afford to have prejudice or thoughts about others as influenced by our role. It needs not to be so, but no one can really be blamed for it. 

Becoming the spectator outside of the main stage, perhaps, is also the act of letting go, even if temporarily. In the audience seat, we had the choice to remain in our costume or in our casual wear in which we have the freedom of expression. 

### B.1. The Auditorium Away from the Stage
As individuals watching the performances in the auditorium, we hardly look at others in the audience seats save for closed ones. We focus on the performance from our angle and discuss with others who, more often than not, see things from a slightly different but similar angle, based on the seats. Perhaps it is the crowded nature of the auditorium that we are unable to see everything, for we lack the freedom of movement to see the performances at other seats. 

But let's take ourselves to a more exclusive spot on the audience seat, where there are but few people in the vast room. Perhaps we have decided to watch this performance alone. In this case, you are free to walk anywhere and see the performance from any desired angle and seat. Indeed, such an opportunity would provide a most complete view of the situation, one that captures everything with, hopefully, the most sincerity.

To be able to come so close to the truth, it must be wonderful. Because in an empty auditorium where we can detach ourselves, we are able to come close to obtaining complete knowledge. In such a space, we have the opportunity to be objective about our judgements, and by that, we hopefully come to a better understanding of others. Because we are not as emotionally involved in our acts but in the performance, perhaps we will be less likely to do something rash.

### B.2. The Stage that Exists between the Spectators
Even the auditorium itself is a stage. A stage with the spectators as the actors. Of course, we still have our own roles, dictated by social norms. For example, it is sensible that we should be polite in public. One is never free from judgement, for there can always be someone who thinks that the person in the seat in front of them was rude, or that their manners were unacceptable. From this perspective, we are both the actor and the spectator. It merely means that the attention is less on ourselves but on the performance ahead.

It is difficult to tell, however, it is more often to see that we do not understand other audiences as well as we thought. Maybe only one annoying feature about them is noticeable, or one good thing about them makes us impressed. We have limited information on who might be sitting next to us, and our opinions about them are less informed. It could be a way to say that when we focus on judging those on the stages, we become less aware of those sitting around us, who could either be strangers or our loved ones. After all, friends do tend to sit next to each other. 

And yet, we are so quick to judge those sitting next to us. Of course, everyone is different. But in certain societies, our manners, movements, and appearance are perhaps enough for people to try and figure out our origin, or the kind of person that we are. It is only natural since we seek to know about those we meet, and I dare say it is a survival instinct to assess the situation. Although this is inevitable, sometimes it could get out of hand when we become too quick to condemn others, or at least, have a negative judgement about them without knowing enough.

I am certainly biased in saying that we should think good of everyone since that is naive on its own. However, I still do think it is better to try and have a good opinion of others as long as we are aware of potential threats if they really are so bad.

## C. Finale
From a certain point of view, we exist in three places at once. We are simultaneously the spotlight of the stage, and also the people sitting in the crowded auditorium. At the same time, we exist in an auditorium watching about a certain matter that no one else could have cared less about.

We have the opportunity to watch others on the stage from any angle we want as we wander through the auditorium, or perhaps we can also decide to see it from one angle only and dive deep into it as we sit with a packed audience. Or, we could also experience it for ourselves as we become the actors and observe others up close to pick at the details and be involved. And if we find the performance to be boring, we may end up watching other people in the seats around us too.

However, all these instances seem to lack an opportunity for us to see ourselves. And indeed, it requires quiet reflection after the performance, or even after watching a play. But certainly what we have felt and thought about while being a spectator is helpful in helping us discern more about ourselves. 

Perhaps being mindful and aware of ourselves is the key, but to do we most likely would need to detach ourselves from our roles both on the stage and in the audience seat. At all points in our lives, we both act for ourselves and spectate others. We are both the actors and the spectators. However, by detaching ourselves from these titles, we may truly be able to reflect and observe our experiences, thoughts, and emotions, to obtain a better understanding of ourselves and those around us. And by doing so, we may be able to become more compassionate with each other.
