title: "(WIP) Moral Dilemma: When Are We Ever Not Selfish?"
category: Discussion

It was very simple. Selfish is if you want something at the direct disadvantage of others, as far as I understand.

But the mentality of "could have" and "should have" haunts me deeply. If I did not spend on myself, I could have helped my family more with that money. If I didn't take this, then others could have have it. With these lines of thoughts, one can give up everything of themselves and still believe that they are selfish for even wanting something they need just to sustain themselves.

One fell into a cycle of considerations, about whether they are taking too much? Because to them, having something means taking it away from others, as if everything is a zero-sum game. I'm mostly talking about myself though. But in an ideal world, then there should be resources available for everyone. Perhaps one grew up in an environment where many things are limited, a place that foster the mentality that one should share and think of family before themselves. No, they perhaps should not even think about themselves.
