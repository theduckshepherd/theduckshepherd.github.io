title: "(WIP) Moral Dilemma: When Are We Ever Not Selfish?"
category: Discussion

It was very simple. Selfish is if you want something at the direct disadvantage of others, as far as I understand.

But the mentality of "could have" and "should have" haunts me deeply. If I did not spend on myself, I could have helped my family more with that money. If I didn't take this, then others could have have it. With these lines of thoughts, one can give up everything of themselves and still believe that they are selfish for even wanting something they need just to sustain themselves.

One fell into a cycle of considerations, about whether they are taking too much? Because to them, having something means taking it away from others, as if everything is a zero-sum game. I'm mostly talking about myself though. But in an ideal world, then there should be resources available for everyone. Perhaps one grew up in an environment where many things are limited, a place that foster the mentality that one should share and think of family before themselves. No, they perhaps should not even think about themselves. Those kinds of people grow up to give unconditionally to others. It's also about a sense of moral obligation. 

Should one even strip oneself of our possessions if others are suffering? Indeed we should give away spares, but for things that are absolutely necessary to one's livelihood with no alternative, it's not advisable to give it away. Because if in our effort to be fair to everyone, we deprive ourselves of everything, then it is unhealthy and unsustainable. Admittedly in the world someone will always be less or more fortunate than us. We are not single handedly dealing with the entire world's affair. Realise that we have support, that we can give as much as we can without hurting ourselves too much, then that is fine. Taking reasonable risk, simply that.

But I grew up in a place where even being alive is selfish because of my fortunate conditions. I was told they could have been stripped away and given to someone else. Then should each of us just die? Because we are luckier than someone in one way or another. Admittedly I wasn't that terrible of a kid, but I had much to learn from. And yet I was always told that I should have been thrown back to where I came from, and the life I have to be given to someone else. Someone who is more grateful and appreciative. Now that I think about it, even if our feelings don't match up the emotional demands of others, as long as we make the most of the opportunities we have, it will be fine.
