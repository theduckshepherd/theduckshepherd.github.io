title: "(WIP) OUR realities remain in OUR perceptions"

About how your reality is basically your perception. It doesn’t matter what the world actually is independently — what Kant calls the noumenal world (thing-in-itself) — because without perceiving it, it exists only as an idea. Any form of evidence we encounter is interpreted by our minds, forming what Kant calls the phenomenal world (things as they appear to us). Regardless, the existence of evidence signals a shared reality for others — what philosophers term intersubjectivity (Husserl, Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology, 1913). That’s what “being real” is defined as.

I could be speaking about Brazil football. To me, it remains just a concept until I interact with it; like fictional worlds, it exists only in my thinking. When I see evidence — photos, videos, news — I acknowledge that it exists somewhere in a shared reality. If I go there, I can interact with it physically, and it becomes part of my lived experience.

Anything fictional that I invest in emotionally is real to me, though not to others — a phenomenon related to subjective reality (Schutz, The Phenomenology of the Social World, 1932). My vivid imagination may bias me, but emotional engagement makes it meaningful.

Social media is an obvious example of a “bubble,” but this extends to all aspects of perception. Anything inside the bubble is “real” to us; anything outside remains an abstract idea. Jean Baudrillard (Simulacra and Simulation, 1981) called this hyperreality, where representations can feel as real as or more real than actual events.

Without your brain, your personal reality doesn’t exist for you, though it may exist for others. By changing how we think, we can alter our own phenomenal reality — not the shared reality everyone interprets, but our subjective experience of it (cf. cognitive reframing in modern psychology).
