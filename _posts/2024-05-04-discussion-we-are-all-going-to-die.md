Simply put, another of my strange post on absurdism, albeit free will is a more interesting topic. From Albert Camus, "for the absurd man, it is not a matter of explaining and solving, but of experiencing and describing. Everything begins with lucid indifference."

A time to take on the difference beween existentialism and absurdism, perhaps?

# A. Determinism 
Death is deterministic. Thus, there is a deterministic outcome. However, the process of getting there is probabilistic. Pray tell, what is the chance that one of us get hit by a car tomorrow!

Anyway, I would rather that not happening. Too much things I would miss out on. In fact, I might die before humanity invent interstellar space travels or wormholes.
