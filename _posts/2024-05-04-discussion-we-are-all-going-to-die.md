Simply put, another of my strange post on absurdism, albeit free will is a more interesting topic. From Albert Camus, "for the absurd man, it is not a matter of explaining and solving, but of experiencing and describing. Everything begins with lucid indifference."

A time to take on the difference beween existentialism and absurdism, perhaps?

# A. Determinism 
Death is deterministic. Thus, there is a deterministic outcome. However, the process of getting there is probabilistic. Pray tell, what is the chance that one of us get hit by a car tomorrow! Anyway, I would rather that not happening. Too much things I would miss out on. In fact, I might die before humanity invent interstellar space travels or wormholes. 


# Existentialism.
Existentialism considers it an essence for ones to create meaning in their life, being aware of the fact that there is no objective meaning. Through that, the creation of meaning becomes a need. The emphasis is placed on the individual being a free and responsible agent. I felt that existentialism displays itself through the act of persistence, continually moving through the absurd. And yet, they seem irrational in that the person becomes _compelled_ to find meaning. Because it is such an essence of the philosophy that it seems a human could not live if just for a second that their life holds meanings no longer. Perhaps it is presumptous of me, but such a person, despite claiming of the inherent nothingness of the universe, they refused to accept or face it. To me, existentialism exists as a form of denial through human's futile attempts at trying to be a significant part of the universe. 

Whether a person consciously deny it because they would not accept a world of nothingness, or if they unconsciously do so because of their inhrent attraction toward meanings, it really is all the same. In creating our meaning, we are imposing meanings onto the world. For myself, I believe in that there is much value in the purity of existence itself. That is, existence of the universe and its absurdity exactly as they are, nothing more and nothing less. Simply its most undisguised form has much to offer.

Through that, we start to embrace. That is absurdism.

# Absurdism
For some reasons, there is a certain charm to absurdism and in what it focuses on. Absurdism focuses simply in embracing the absurd. In accepting the truth for what it is and decided to live it anyway. To live in the truth, and to constantly acknowledging the truth that is our constant awareness of the absurd in our lives. To live in reality in its purest form, in all its essence. Suddenly, it all becomes more colorful.

Absurdism is just that, the realisation of the absurd. There is no other ideologies attached. But I myself believe that to see the absurd is to also accept and recognise the truth of the universe. Because it is an essential part to stare into the void and acknowledge its existence to realise just how large the gaps between men and everything else.

Perhaps for myself, I do like living for the truth. For the sake of getting to know the truth of so many things, like an endless pursuit of knowledge. Each person's experiences are different. But eventually, I came to be curious of the absurd, of its presence in the world. And even if the philosophical tension tears a person's mind apart, one could not help but be attracted toward that incomprehensible void anyway, like moth to the flame. 

Absurdism grants freedom to a person in that they no longer belongs to the future. That they no longer become bounded to some abstract goal or any form of meaning. There is no longer a need to keep chasing toward a goal. At the same time, the absurdist is bounded to their awareness of the absurd. I dare say men shackles themselves with their own knowledge, for what is learned cannot be unlearned. Even though we stare at the void that is the inherent meaninglessness of the universe and the futility of our actions, we are bounded to keep chasing toward that same unfathomable abyss. But we do so with a passion. A passion to revolt.

When the world is devoid of any absolutes, of any goals to achieve, of any deterministic meanings, then we are truly free. This is what it means to not belong to the future. Men no longer is bounded by some abstract conceptions, but only by their own knowledge and themselves. And yet Albert Camus never spoke much of free will, since indeed, it does not matter. Even if we are bounded to a nihilistic end, we are free to choose within the limited choices we have. Even the concept of "true freedom" contradicts itself in a way that any decision must be made from some sort of "vessels" or "consciousness". Then, such thing is already bounded. Perhaps there is no true freewill that can exist, but only the freedom to choose from the cards on our hands.
