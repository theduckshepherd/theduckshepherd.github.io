Inherently, we all want to be treated fairly. Something that isn't fair for us is a red flag that must be addressed. What about fairness for all?

# A. Fairness, What It Implies
Fairness is a subjective concept, for the most part. However, we can grasp a sense of what the term means through the way it is expected of others. A judge is expected to be fair, that is, impartial. A teacher is expected to be fair, that is, no favoritism. In a relationship, fairness may implies reciprocation. Typically, fairness implies "equal treatments for both parties".

Think of a scale. If one sides get more and one sides get less, that is imbalanced. The scale must be restored so both sides are at equal levels. Justice is commonly compared to the symbolism of a scale. But in a complex sense, fairness doesn't only implies 'being equal'. Equality assumes everyone benefit from the same support. Equity makes sure that everyone gets the right support to ensure equal access. Justice, not pertaining to its definition in the court of law, ensures that the original inequity is addressed so that everyone have equal access without needing support. The systematic barrier is removed.

The above is probably something people have heard of before. As an example, let's say that we have a "women association" for a lot of things to advocate for women. I don't deny that in the past, men had been heavily favored and only recently do women get to vote or the same rights that men do. Although the effort to give women the fairness that they deserve is much appreciated, the issue of gender should never have been a problem to begin with. Gender should never have been a reason for discrimination. But our society is just that good at discriminating others for whatever reasons, be it by race, heritage, heights, skin color, beliefs, hobbies, etc. Humans are good at jugding others, that's it.

# B. Fairness is to be Neutral
I imagine that to actually understand fairness, all of us including me would have to look into the very foundations of our social norms, about what should be neutral and what shouldn't be. Sometimes, we unconsciously make stereotypes of a certain group, and that already put us into a biased position. In this sense, I'm speaking of fairness as thinking in an impartial manner, and act in the similarly impartial manner. 

Most importantly, a person's human rights and their safety stand before everything else that we constitute as fairness. Even if "an eye for an eye" rule seems fair, it is inherently unhealthy in that it creates a vicious cycle of taking revenge back and forth. And in doing so I believe that we have already threatened a person's security, all the while knowing that everyone is [entitled to life, liberty, and security of person][universal_declaration]. Of course, a person is to be given their due for what they have done, no more no less. If any more, it is an act of generosity. If any less, we are to appreciate it anyway, and if needed, seek to collect our due without being petty. We should all treat each other in the spirit of brotherhood. 

If a person commmitted a crime, they are to be given their punishment as per the law, and be given the support needed to make a recovery and welcomed back into society. In a perfect, ideal universe, everyone would be supportive of each other so that no one has to stray so far as to commit mortal sins or the kinds of actions that would impact others' livelihood. In such a world, even if a crime is committed, I hope that person would be forgiven eventually, out of our generosity. Even if we were the victims, we should not simply amplify our own sufferings and impose a harsher punishments on the perpetrator. That kind of neutrality, or kindness, should always come out on top. 

Likewise, in an argument, we are to acknowledge both sides of the argument. To be neutral, we must know of the facts and acknowledge them. Denial already is a bias in itself that is difficult to fix. Because we will no longer reason with our mind but with our emotions. And although emotions and feelings are not wrong, they should not overwhelm us or lead us toward making irrational decisions. Sometimes we will slip up, but admittedly many of the world's miseries come from anger, hatred, desire for revenge, greed, ego, and our tendencies to discriminate or look down on others. I believe they are all human feelings. War, crimes, corruption; I believe they sprout forth from the human hearts. Because negative feelings are all too proficient at creating a spiral feedback loop that only keep feeding into our feelings. Truly, people think with their feelings sometimes. And they could be the most passionate person ever. Or they could also be the most stubborn person ever. Because I think that somewhere, we want to protect our ego and feelings. By that, we willingly take on a position that is no longer neutral.

# C. Fairness through the Expression of Logic
Althogh there might be differences in how 'fairness' can be attained, I believe it should be done through logic, that is, the ways in which conclusions are arrived. Everything there is to do with logic has to do with the original basis that it stemmed from. A flawed basis is tantamount to the irrational. A logical process infected with fallacies is also nonsense. I say this because more often than not, an emotion-based argument can never be truly argued logically, for it is too easy for such a basis to generate fallacies based on the human's subjective experience. However, to begin with a neutral basis that is commonly accepted to be morally right fits for a more stable logical foundation. Emotions should definitely be factored in the conversation, but any arguments that follow in that conversation must flow logically.

# Case Study: Discrimination
Admittedly, too many forms of discrimination exist. Racism, sexism, fascism, all sorts of things.
