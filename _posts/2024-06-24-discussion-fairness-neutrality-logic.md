Inherently, we all want to be treated fairly. Something that isn't fair for us is a red flag that must be addressed. What about fairness for all?

# A. Fairness, What It Implies
Fairness is a subjective concept, for the most part. However, we can grasp a sense of what the term means through the way it is expected of others. A judge is expected to be fair, that is, impartial. A teacher is expected to be fair, that is, no favoritism. In a relationship, fairness may implies reciprocation. Typically, fairness implies "equal treatments for both parties".

Think of a scale. If one sides get more and one sides get less, that is imbalanced. The scale must be restored so both sides are at equal levels. Justice is commonly compared to the symbolism of a scale. But in a complex sense, fairness doesn't only implies 'being equal'. Equality assumes everyone benefit from the same support. Equity makes sure that everyone gets the right support to ensure equal access. Justice, not pertaining to its definition in the court of law, ensures that the original inequity is addressed so that everyone have equal access without needing support. The systematic barrier is removed.

# B. Fairness is to be Neutral

# C. Fairness through the Expression of Logic
Althogh there might be differences in how 'fairness' can be attained, I believe it should be done through logic, that is, the ways in which conclusions are arrived. Everything there is to do with logic has to do with the original basis that it stemmed from. A flawed basis is tantamount to the irrational. A logical process infected with fallacies is also nonsense. I say this because more often than not, an emotion-based argument can never be truly argued logically, for it is too easy for such a basis to generate fallacies based on the human's subjective experience. However, to begin with a neutral basis that is commonly accepted to be morally right fits for a more stable logical foundation. Emotions should definitely be factored in the conversation, but any arguments that follow in that conversation must flow logically.

# Case Study: Discrimination
Admittedly, too many forms of discrimination exist. Racism, sexism, fascism, all sorts of things.
