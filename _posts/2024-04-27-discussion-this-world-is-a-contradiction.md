Contradictions, I dare say, are the hallmark of absurdism. Yet that is not the reason this discussion came to life. However, it is truly odd that we never thought much of the contradictory nature of everything around us, and thus the absurdity of the world.

# A. The Contradiction of Truth
First, if attention may be brought to this statement by Aristotle, as quoted by Albert Camus in his essay The Myth of Sisyphus:
> The often ridiculed consequence of these opinions is that they destroy themselves. For by asserting that all is true we assert the truth of the contrary assertion and consequently the falsity of our own thesis (for the contrary assertion does not admit that it can be true). And if one says that all is false, that assertion is itself false. If we declare that solely the assertion opposed to ours is false or else that solely ours is not false, we are nevertheless forced to admit an infinite number of true or false judgments. For the one who expresses a true assertion proclaims simultaneously that it is true, and so on ad infinitum.

This statement simply brought forth the contradiction of truth itself. In asserting that something is true, we are also obligated by our own logic to assert of the falsity of something else. Furthermore, we are also obligated to prove of the truth beyond our assertion that nonetheless derived from it. If one is to take the meaning of understanding to be one of unification (as Albert Camus understood it), or in my own words, to understand is to reconcile concepts in a harmonic manner,then the world is incomprehensible. The world is at odds with itself and yet its puzzle pieces nevertheless fit perfectly together that the cogs are still running. This contradiction, by itself, is the proof of further contradictions born from it. One may admit that the truly absurd matter is the fact that our mind cannot understand, that in out own comprehension we are already absurd. Then, is the fact that we are using such an imperfect mind to solve a problem not absurd in itself, knowing that even a perfect premise but with an imperfect tool yield naught but falsehood?
