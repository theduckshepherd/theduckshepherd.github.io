Contradictions, I dare say, are the hallmark of absurdism. Yet that is not the reason this discussion came to life. However, it is truly odd that we never thought much of the contradictory nature of everything around us, and thus the absurdity of the world.

# A. The Contradiction of Truth
First, if attention may be brought to this statement by Aristotle, as quoted by Albert Camus in his essay The Myth of Sisyphus:
> The often ridiculed consequence of these opinions is that they destroy themselves. For by asserting that all is true we assert the truth of the contrary assertion and consequently the falsity of our own thesis (for the contrary assertion does not admit that it can be true). And if one says that all is false, that assertion is itself false. If we declare that solely the assertion opposed to ours is false or else that solely ours is not false, we are nevertheless forced to admit an infinite number of true or false judgments. For the one who expresses a true assertion proclaims simultaneously that it is true, and so on ad infinitum.
