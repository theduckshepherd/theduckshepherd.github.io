Caffeine is supposed to keep you awake. For a while, it does work, but not without my heart beating fast and feeling a bit odd after. Still, I used to like the taste. I never learned to make coffee properly and made it the same way you would make tea. Coffee and some hot water, milk, and sugar. I could only judge based on the color. That's probably why I always ended up having more caffeine intake than I should have. Just a little bit more.

At one point, I was very down. It doesn't help when an adult figure in your life is narcissistic, as loving as they were. And I was not of a clear mind to fully understand their actions or words. They seem to have a particular dislike for me, and perhaps everything I do was never really mine, only to be invalidated. That I could not achieve anything without their help. Admittedly, there are things that I accomplish by myself, but that won't be acknowledged. I really just want to not be misunderstood or to be left alone. Autism doesn't help much when dealing with such people. But at the same time, it allows me to identify their tricks once I am mature and have sufficient understanding. That I wouldn't buy into their "social norms." A blessing and a curse, I think. But I wouldn't change myself for that. Maybe being autistic gives me a slightly more trusting and positive outlook.

So on that occasion, November 2023, I drank the equivalent of 10 cups of coffee in one go. Effectively overdosing myself. I knew it wouldn't kill me, but it would hurt enough. And it did. My body was shaking and my head spun; I could not make out any directions. I was vomiting until the morning after, no matter what I ate or drunk. And my body spasmed for hours. Perhaps that was one of the worst 24 hours I've ever had.

A certain someone, which I mentioned before, did tell me to eat some food anyway. That person asked why I did it. Not for an answer, but only to tell me I shouldn't have done that. They did tell me about the effect of drinking coffee on an empty stomach. They just didn't really register the fact that it wasn't an empty stomach. It was a caffeine overdose. And they told me that if my gastrointestinal system has problems, I can go back to Vietnam and cry to my parents about it. And my parents can take me to the hospital or something, since I was being so dramatic.

Think back about it; perhaps they thought I was causing too many problems for them. And with some deep digs, perhaps my emotions or feelings never mattered to them. Because my autism and inability to please them or understand them have frustrated them so much, it didn't matter what I felt. It is all about what they feel, always about "now you know what I feel." That person was never able to detach me as a person from my origin and parents.

I was never able to understand them, but they branded me with the label of being intentionally ungrateful and uncooperative. All of it was a misunderstanding. But since I am too isolated from either of my families already, at this point, parents don't mean anything. Just leave me alone for the next few years while I recover. All of you have been so noisy. I don't understand why I have to pick sides. That person considers many things to be betrayal and ungrateful to them; it's hard to express an opinion that makes both sides happy.

That person can talk about me being "orphaned" by my parents for all they want. Do I care? They still gave birth to me. What's done is done. Please don't make me feel unwanted even more. I already know enough. It's a tug of war. I don't want to go back to either side since you already have such controls over me. And since you have been so determined to make me feel unloved and unwanted from my own family, please don't act as some sort of salvation for me too.Â 

You talk about how it's an unhealthy emotion, but you made others feel the same. Perhaps all of us have to reflect.

In the end, my happiness remains in my hands. I won't hand it over. I realise what I can and cannot have, so from now on you won't get to decide or make me feel bad. That sort of normal parent-child relationship is already out of reach. I can't become younger. But time moves us forward anyway. Narcissism isn't curable once it has gotten too far, and no, you won't change your mind. I don't need you to try either way.

Since then, I have not made coffee for myself except the 3-in-1 types. It's been 8 months already.
