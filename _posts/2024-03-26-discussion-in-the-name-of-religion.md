Here's a more sensitive, touchy one. On the matter of religion.

# A. In the Name of Religion's Righteousness
Religion taught us the ways of life that is judged to be good, with principles that would better humanity. And as such, we all strive to act on these principles and to behave accordingly. Naturally, religion is akin to righteousness itself. Then, it is also only natural that anything we do in the name of religion, we believe that we do so for the greater good. Reality couldn't be any further than that, because just how much have we messed for what we have done in the name of religion? 

Some can become zealous and the extreme end of the spectrum would be those that are considered religious extremists. We have seen violence happened because of them. The Crusade itself, while done in the name of religion to take back the Christian Holy Land which at the time was also the Muslims' Holy Land, was essentially a war of conquest in simple terms, although I will not touch more on this subject given to my lack of comprehensive knowledge on the matter. At least, it is hard to say that the Crusade was justified. Then likewise, not everything that we do in the name of religion is also justified.

People seek to be right, and since religions contain the tenets of righteousness, naturally people hope to become righteous through their own faith. Indeed, it is a very good work if done in a balanced manners. When we speak of God, we speak of faith which is an extremely personal matter to us.
