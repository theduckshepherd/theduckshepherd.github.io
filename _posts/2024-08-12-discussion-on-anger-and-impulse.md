Anger is a human passion, so to speak. Here I am speaking of passion as strong and intense emotions. Perhaps this is more of a discussion over how I've seen anger being expressed in others around me.

# C. Meltdowns
Time for a bit of self reflection. Here's the thing: I am generally very chill and calm. Sure, I'm confused for most of my life about things. But I don't get a lot of emotional responses when people are being weird, annoying, or just mean to me. I do feel annoyed and think that the other is unreasonable. Perhaps it's also because of alexithymia. I highly suspect that I do have alexithymia as part of my (suspected) autism. And usually I'm quite logical, so I do not buy into people's weird arguments that are only driven by emotions and a desire to win. There's no winning or solving any issues with arguments like that.

Here's another thing: I do get explosively angry. It's basically imploding. Yes, I have thrown my phone before (it's doing fine). I have also thrown a chair (it's a plastic chair). And because this practically did not happen before, I was actually starting to question if I was as calm as I thought. I never scream at people. But I have once screamed out of frustrations. And it was literally the opposite of who I was. I was stomping my feet and wanting to do all sorts of things like just wandering off somewhere, or punching someone back. Fortunately, I've never have the guts to punch people since that would hurt them. 

I do know that autism does make impulse control harder. Well, it is also a part of ADHD. And when I get angry, it just instantly flare up. One second I'm all chill. There are no indications that my anger was rising. The next second, I would be tempted to throw everything around the room.

And that's really what a meltdown is, I think. I would be wanting to cry, to scream, and to throw stuff. But I have enough sanity even in those episodes to not do things that could endanger people or could cause serious damage. Recently, I've figured out that when I do feel that kind of anger, I can recognise it. It might be irrational, but it's fine. Just feel it and let it calm down gradually, and in the meantime do not engage again. Even though it was about to implode, my expression would just look absolutely confused, staring and blinking. So people wouldn't even know until it gets bad.

Meltdowns typically happen when something really annoy me. Or when a boundary is crossed. Recently, someone who is nearly 30 years older than me just seem to get petty. I was simply asking if they could just not grab me by my clothes like that, and they pulled at it again. Then I ask if they can just not touch me in general, they keep pulling once and just walk off. It didn't hurt, but I was somewhat close to just throw something at their face. I simply can't understand the lack of understanding, the childish nature of that action alone. If it was a school, that would be considered bullying.

When I was in primary school, I did hit people with ruler or sticks. I realise that it was simply impulsive anger. Mini-meltdowns. A certain action would suddenly spark me to chase after them and try to hit them. I didn't really understand myself, and of course, why would any primary school kids would. But I even threw a phone once because the autocorrect ticked me off. And since the phone didn't crack, I must have thought it was acceptable to do it. So I threw it again when it ticked me off, but this time the phone slid across the room and cracked. That incident made me feel deeply regretful and ashamed for at least 5 years after that, but now I'm over it.

At the start of this year, a phone call made me angry and I threw my phone again. I was surprised too, because it must have been almost 10 years since the last time I threw my phone in anger. But now that I linked back those incidents, they were meltdowns. Impulsiveness that I did not yet learn to control. But not a lot of things make me feel like that, and if it does, someone really have crossed the line. I usually either calm down by myself, or just tearing off old papers to let off some steams. My emotions die down pretty quick so it isn't all bad. Funny, isn't it? I never thought things from the past were all linked.
