We get one birthday a year. Celebration is a tradition. Especially when one turns to adulthood. Many take such a day to be important and eventful since it is such a milestone. But in the end, is it not just a social construct?

The law requires a definitive mark in time for it to be effective. For example, upon reaching certain age, an individual will become able to perform things they could not before. Most famously, drinking and gambling. Still, it is a common thing for those who reached adulthood on their birthday to go out for a drink with friends, as a testament to say that they are now an adult.

With the changes to a person's legal "definition" in the law, there are responsibilities that follow. For example, one will be charged as an adult in the Criminal Court. One is bound to any contract one has signed. Perhaps the permitted blood alcohol level when driving would apply differently to different age ranges. Within the family, expectations of an adult are suddenly put on their shoulders. It's only natural that from that day forth, this person is now an adult, and he or she is to be treated as such.

But look, there are many immature adults. We don't magically mature or become awesome overnight. It's simply the same clock ticking away, second by second. You will wake up, feeling the same as yesterday. Someone I know said that people don't fully mature until the age of 30. Just look around, there are many young adults doing reckless things, because they aren't fully mature yet. Many are still working their ways through life, even when they have become older. Really, it's unrealistic to expect someone to change overnight. And the same goes for the birthday that marks someone's adulthood.

Some also put emphasis on celebrating birthdays on the day. Some feel entitled to be treated nicely, and look, who doesn't? To those who believed that their birthday is special, they demand better treatment. And others know it too. Which is probably why we have parties, we have celebrations and birthday wishes. Sometimes, people don't want to celebrate birthdays anymore, and they would treat themselves to something lighter, like a drink or going out for dinner. Most of us take it as a day for us to enjoy ourselves. We automatically consider our birthdays to be our 'rest days', of sort. Some people are duty-bound and don't get to enjoy their birthdays, but they would usually compensate for it by celebrating earlier, or after. Or do nothing at all. But see, we all like to celebrate such a day that coincide with the day we come into the world.

We don't want our birthdays ruined. Sometimes, we just want to celebrate it in our own ways, whether it be alone or with families and/or friends. Some wants to be alone, some don't. Some feels pressured to celebrate, and some feels lonely when no one celebrate it with them. I fall into the former. For the age of adulthood, I believe it's a good time for me to contemplate and reflect. I dislike having to put up with celebrations from families. Admittedly, they should be included, and they want to celebrate it on the day. But sometimes I just want the day to myself, and we can celebrate it on another day. Normally, it would be great
