We get one birthday a year. Celebration is a tradition. Especially when one turns to adulthood. Many take such a day to be important and eventful since it is such a milestone. But in the end, is it not just a social construct?

The law requires a definitive mark in time for it to be effective. For example, upon reaching certain age, an individual will become able to perform things they could not before. Most famously, drinking and gambling. Still, it is a common thing for those who reached adulthood on their birthday to go out for a drink with friends, as a testament to say that they are now an adult.

With the changes to a person's legal "definition" in the law, there are responsibilities that follow. For example, one will be charged as an adult in the criminal court. One is bound to any contract one has signed. Perhaps the permitted blood alcohol level when driving would apply differently to different age ranges. Within the family, expectations of an adult are suddenly put on their shoulders. It's only natural that from that day forth, this person is now an adult, and he or she is to be treated as such.

But look, there are many immature adults. We don't magically mature or become awesome overnight. It's simply the same clock ticking away, second by second. You will wake up feeling the same as yesterday. Someone I know said that people don't fully mature until the age of 30. Just look around; there are many young adults doing reckless things because they aren't fully mature yet. Many are still working their way through life, even when they have become older. Really, it's unrealistic to expect someone to change overnight. And the same goes for the birthday that marks someone's adulthood.

Some also put emphasis on celebrating birthdays on the day. Some feel entitled to be treated nicely, and look, who doesn't? To those who believe that their birthday is special, they demand better treatment. And others know it too. Which is probably why we have parties; we have celebrations and birthday wishes. Sometimes, people don't want to celebrate birthdays anymore, and they would treat themselves to something lighter, like a drink or going out for dinner. Most of us take it as a day for us to enjoy ourselves. We automatically consider our birthdays to be our'rest days', of sorts. Some people are duty-bound and don't get to enjoy their birthdays, but they would usually compensate for it by celebrating earlier or after. Or do nothing at all. But see, we all like to celebrate such a day that coincides with the day we come into the world.

We don't want our birthdays ruined. Sometimes, we just want to celebrate it in our own ways, whether it be alone or with families and/or friends. Some want to be alone, some don't. Some feel pressured to celebrate, and some feel lonely when no one celebrates it with them. I fall into the former. For the age of adulthood, I believe it's a good time for me to contemplate and reflect. I dislike having to put up with celebrations from families. Admittedly, they should be included, and they want to celebrate it on the day. But sometimes I just want the day to myself, and we can celebrate it on another day. Normally, it would be great if others respected how we wanted to celebrate, but some are just more insistent on dragging us into a family dinner or party. For family, I suppose you can only comply and go along out of kindness. And it's also polite to do so.

As for myself, I don't think I would want to celebrate birthdays with anyone close to me ever again. Once in 2022, people were displeased with me and had me out the balcony. And at night, they still tried and gave me noodles and donuts. And yet all I could recall was how they said that I was such a disappointment, despite how hard they tried for me. Look at what they get for my birthday—so considerate!

But... is this about me anymore? Or is it about the fact that I was undeserving of their supposed kindness? Just leave me alone. Because now I have been made into a horrible person. It's love bombing. An attempt to demonstrate affection to influence a person, but in the end it was misused as a tool to play with my feelings like so.

And an adult who I have been extremely conflicted about for most of my life, they said something along the line of my birthday being meaningless, with how horrible I was. And that it should be my death anniversary instead.

For some reasons, it stuck. I'm not sure if it's fate, but for the next two birthdays, I didn't go out for dinner with them. The first year that followed, the family was busy, so we did not go out in the end. And for the second year, we just didn't. I would have liked it to be this way anyway. Because it seems that the most important day could be turned against me. The fact that it's somewhat special to me and that this knowledge is known to others makes it a weakness. 

Perhaps I will only ever celebrate my birthday on my own. Celebrations with families or friends should always fall on another day. And in fact, I can just make any day be my birthday. I can just decide to treat myself just as well as a birthday me would. It's just a clock ticking.

In the end, it simply means that I no longer trust others with my happiness. Others can share in it, but I will have ownership. And when everything falls down, the pieces I shared will return to me because they are mine alone. If someone relishes in making me feel bad about myself, they can go screw themselves.
