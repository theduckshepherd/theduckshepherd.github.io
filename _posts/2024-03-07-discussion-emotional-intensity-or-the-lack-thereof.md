To begin with, this post has more to do with alexithymia, as in "no words to describe emotions". It is not a mental disorder but more of a personality trait ([Source][autistica]). It is not even listed in the DSM. Statistically, 1 in 10 people has this condition ([Source][autistica]), while 1 in 5 autistic individuals has this condition. So clearly it is more prevalent for those on the Autism Disorder Spectrum. There is no confirmed correlation, simply that alexithymia more often than not occurs with autism, but may not occur by it ([Source][apathy_alexithymia_link]). That is the current consensus anyway.

# A. Bits and Pieces on Myself (Autism), and Alexithymia
I dare not diagnose myself, and I would really love to see a neuropsychologist on this. I suspected that I might be on the Autism Disorder Spectrum, but of course, not as bad as being mentally impaired. It's more informally referred to as Asperger's syndrome, or high-functioning autism. Do note that Asperger's syndrome has now been absorbed into the Autism Disorder Spectrum as per the DSM-5 manual. I consider it a gift, really, because whatever characteristics I have now, whether it comes from being on the spectrum or not, have come to be wonderful. Perhaps high-functioning autism is the word, but generally high-functioning autistic people can live independently. Such a delicate balance that I could not help thanking God for it. Mostly, because I liked my gifts very much.

## A.1. Autism Spectrum Disorder
Whether or not I’m diagnosed with autism (or Asperger’s) is of little importance other than to understand myself better. If anything, I do like the fact that there are other individuals on the spectrum that I could relate to.

So far, I do have quite a few traits on the spectrum. Odd intonation or inability to even recognise intonation at all. Odd speech patterns that go round and round with metaphor simply because I wanted to be precisely accurate. Terribly blunt that it’s probably rude sometimes. Hyperfixation on certain things to the point it’s unhealthy. Getting too absorbed into one thing and forgetting everything else. I like to do things by myself. Get frustrated when my schedule gets disturbed by others. Sometimes I take things too literally. I really can’t tell what people feel. I can’t pick up social cues. Always feel slightly agitated and can’t help but fidget around, not being able to stand or sit still. Hyperactivity, only able to sit still when extremely focused, or else my mind jumps everywhere. Socially awkward. Hate social situations, even at parties I just sit there like a duck. Can’t hold small conversations and am always highly distracted if I’m not interested in the matters at hand.
Unfortunately, we have certain traits that others won't understand about us. Misunderstandings are common.

Still, I believe it is what allowed me to be a funny person. 

## A.2. Alexithymia
From my limited understanding, alexithymia involves a lack of emotional intensity as neurotypicals. Emotions are the sensations experienced through external stimuli and last only seconds or minutes. Feelings are derived from our thoughts on those emotions, both emotionally and physically. And just as I have mentioned, "no words to describe emotions" quite literally means I don't process it into feelings, or if it does, it won't last long.

Coupled with the fact that for 11 years of my life, I were never exposed to yelling or violence within the environment, it gave me an example of the kind of peaceful person I wanted to be. That is something I am most grateful for. Although I had a childish impulsiveness as a kid, growing up I never learned to scream or criticise others. And I too was quick to forgive and forget. Nature vs nurture complement each other nicely.

I suppose I admire those who forgive after going through a rollercoaster of emotions and feelings. I felt as if I had taken the easy route, that by not being able to 'feel' at all I have an unfair advantage. 

If I may refer to my previous post on immersion and daydreaming, then I only feel the physical effect of emotions, or a tug in the heart when immersing myself in stories or my own head.

## B. Many a Misunderstanding
I supposed I was also fascinated with the ability to feel. Because the world will never understand that we could not feel as intensely as them. We could not react as intensely as them. So they consider us heartless, apathetic, and fake. By 'they', I refer to some of the people closest to me.

Their fault, or shortcomings, lie in their attempt to interpret someone whose mind is distinctly different than theirs. It only makes sense that when a group of autistic individuals may struggle to interpret neurotypical people and vice versa.

At some points not being able to feel things as strongly as them means that any attempt at doing so is considered fake. Which, indeed was fake. After all, I could not be as intense as them. At some points, I thought that there was something wrong with me and I tried to imitate others’ emotions just as much. Of course, I could not feel it as deeply and I ended up questioning myself if there was something inherently wrong with me.

Besides, alexithymia more often than not is genetic plus environment. Generally speaking, some people are more prone to it, and for some, it might be developed after traumatic events. One does not simply acquire such personality traits out of nowhere if they were not already prone to it or born with it, I believe. Besides, one can develop it simply because of certain events in their life, not necessarily because of those around them. But some people close to me think otherwise. Well, I imagined they are talking about my behaviours that derived from that personality trait, which indeed is not exactly a good role model.

But at least for us, anything that has to be driven by emotions, we could not do it. Not a passionate revenge. We function on a "why not?" mentality sometimes, and are a bit of an externally oriented thinking (cite).

[Apathy][apathy_def] is defined to be a lack of interest, more often than not. Having alexithymia does not mean we are completely apathetic. We still feel things inside but struggle to feel connected and express that ([Source][apathy_alexithymia_link])

## C. Shortcomings, and the Link to Morality
I'm almost certain that the people around me in my family are neurotypical. They have emotions, so they may not understand why I don't. Likewise, I don't understand how they hold grudges or get mad for so long, because I lack the emotional intensity for it. I suppose outside of our bubbles everything is like that, so perhaps it's best to accept and come toward a compromise.

At some points, they start linking my lack of expression, or any of my expression at all, to my personal characteristics and morality. Specifically, the lack of emotions was linked to their presumptions that I could not feel emotions I should feel, such as gratitude and respect. Being aware of our own problems made us more conscious of our hesitancy about our own emotions. And to the neurotypicals that is considered lacking those emotions and thus we are terrible people. It should be realised that the inability to identify and describe emotions does not correlate to the lack of emotions.

This was not helpful, especially since they are actors who are so emotionally involved in their own lives, that to me everything becomes inconsistent. It is genuine, and yet it does not make sense. I lack the nuances to understand how this works, or how one's clothes could possibly fuse into one's skin like so.

Maybe they never understood that some people are just born that way. Nothing was wrong with them. But still, maybe the stuff they said to me was their attempt at provoking me or rousing my emotions. It is alright, they tried within their limitations. Only that I possibly also lack the ability to remember my emotions. What was said and what was felt once gone is gone.

Regardless, I don't think we can ever be enough. Even I myself have the tendency to dismiss others when they express strong emotions such as jealousy or self-pity. Even though I might have been the same, I don't like the fact that someone may get stuck in the pit that they have dug for themselves for too long, only to throw the dirt back up at everyone else standing next to the pit as they keep digging away. Although this is perhaps a bad analogy for self-pity.

## D. Resolution
Maybe the challenge here is not the difference between individuals, but more about how in our difficulty to relate to others we have mistakenly imposed our perceptions on others. Our perceptions drive our actions, I believe. Statistically speaking, a census that receives answers from the entire population is bound to be more representative than a survey. So having everyone's input is best.
