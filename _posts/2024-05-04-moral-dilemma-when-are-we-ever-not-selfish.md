title: "(WIP) Moral Dilemma: When Are We Ever Not Selfish?"

On the concept of omnipotent responsibility guilt, which also has to do with control mastery theory. I'm not well versed with psychology, so this can be considered an instropection or investigation the idea itself.

# A. The Problem, as in, Background
It was very simple. Selfish is if you want something at the direct disadvantage of others, as far as I understand.

But the mentality of "could have" and "should have" haunts me deeply. If I did not spend on myself, I could have helped my family more with that money. If I didn't take this, then others could have have it. With these lines of thoughts, one can give up everything of themselves and still believe that they are selfish for even wanting something they need just to sustain themselves.

One fell into a cycle of considerations, about whether they are taking too much? Because to them, having something means taking it away from others, as if everything is a zero-sum game. I'm mostly talking about myself though. But in an ideal world, then there should be resources available for everyone. Perhaps one grew up in an environment where many things are limited, a place that foster the mentality that one should share and think of family before themselves. No, they perhaps should not even think about themselves. Those kinds of people grow up to give unconditionally to others. It's also about a sense of moral obligation. 

Should one even strip oneself of our possessions if others are suffering? Indeed we should give away spares, but for things that are absolutely necessary to one's livelihood with no alternative, it's not advisable to give it away. Because if in our effort to be fair to everyone, we deprive ourselves of everything, then it is unhealthy and unsustainable. Admittedly in the world someone will always be less or more fortunate than us. We are not single handedly dealing with the entire world's affair. Realise that we have support, that we can give as much as we can without hurting ourselves too much, then that is fine. Taking reasonable risk, simply that.

But I grew up in a place where even being alive is selfish because of my fortunate conditions. I was told they could have been stripped away and given to someone else. Then should each of us just die? Because we are luckier than someone in one way or another. Admittedly I wasn't that terrible of a kid, but I have much to learn from. And yet I was always told that I should have been thrown back to where I came from, and the life I have to be given to someone else. Someone who is more grateful and appreciative. Now that I think about it, even if our feelings don't match up the emotional demands of others, as long as we make the most of the opportunities we have, it will be fine.

# B. The Problem in the Problem
Very clearly, it is not our responsibility to solve everyone's problems. By that, I mean, _everyone_. This is a concept in psychology called "omnipotent responsibility guilt". It simply comes from a pathogenic belief. Admittedly, in our early stages guilt is a beneficial emotion, in that it allows us to adapt ourselves better to the environment around us. At least, it was a tool by which we can use to adjust our behaviour. Even so, I still believe guilt is a negative emotion, and negative emotions can never offer much value after a certain stage before it become harmful.

Here I shall cite the concept from a Scandinavian study in 2022 ([Source][study1]). Firstly, on the concept of omnipotent guilt cited from the same source:
> 1. Omnipotent responsibility guilt, which is an expression of the belief that one has the duty and the power to make loved ones happy, so that putting oneâ€™s needs in the foreground means being selfish;
> 
> 2. They are shaped by early experiences with caregivers that led the child to believe that pursuing healthy goals could cause suffering in significant others or endanger the person and their close relationship.
> 
> 3. Omnipotence guilt were found to be stronger in people who grew up feeling that their caregivers needed their support, had more problems than them, or appeared burdened by them or hurt by their separation and individuation

The flaws in the belief that one is responsible for the burdens or misfortune that befall a person's loved ones lies in the cognitive errors that assume causality. Even though the events might be unrelated, it is still possible to think along the line that "I have displeased someone, this must be the reason leading to their car accident because they might have been so burdened that they could not keep themselves safe". Of course, this is only an example where this is slightly more obvious, but again to some it makes perfect sense, and that responsibilities should fall upon the person with such thoughts. And by empathetically perceiving the distress in others, irrational guilt and pathological forms of altruism are elicited. 

Admittedly, autistic individuals seem to be worse in cognitive empathy that requires recognition of emotions from cues such as facial expression. And yet the same people may have better affective empathy, which involves instincts and involuntary responses to the emotions of others; in that case we simply get affected by others' emotions more intensely. However, note that this is from a separate source which should be taken on a case-by-case basis for each individual. Perhaps, then, that it is easier to invoke irrational guilt in us, or at least in myself who can immerse in the emotions of others as if I was them. As much as I do not like the idea, I do think that the ideas of guilt and moral obligation are almost blurred together in my mind.
