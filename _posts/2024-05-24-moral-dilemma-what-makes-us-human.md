title: "(WIP) Moral Dilemma: What Makes us Human?"

We treat because we think someone is human. What defines human? Sentient?

Then think someone is less of a human means we can discriminate?


Why must fairness be maintained in such ways? Why should we even consider if someone is human or not to start treating them right? Even from the basis, the assumption was already flawed.
