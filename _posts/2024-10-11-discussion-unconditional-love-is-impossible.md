I should say that this post will be religious, but please feel free to have your own take on it.

# Unconditional Love is Unrealistic
Let's put it this way. We love and we wants to be loved. Unconditional love means putting our trust in the other person, that they will love us back just as much. We open our hearts, we show them who we are, and we open up to the possibility of being hurt and exploited. 

So realistically, we should put up certain rules and conditions to protect ourselves. Sometimes these rules are realistic, such as, "I can't love you if you cheat on me", or "I can't love you if you keep abusing me". Again, this is really up to the nuances of the relationship, it depends on what are considered the limits. And whether this limit actually makes sense. It's simply unreasonable to say that "If you can't stop crying, do not be my kid", or "If you don't give me your finances, you don't love me and we shouldn't be together". To some extent, things can become manipulative. Regardless, every form of human love involves conditions, whether it be to protect us, or our ego over others.

And yes, it is unrealistic in every way. It works only in a perfect world, an unrealistic world that isn't yet tangible to us. This precisely is why only God is capable of it. Because He can do things that are deemed unrealistic or impossible. For God's sake, he could make anything be the reality.
