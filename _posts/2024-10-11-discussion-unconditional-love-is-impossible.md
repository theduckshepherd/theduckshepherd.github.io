I should say that this post will be religious, but please feel free to have your own take on it.

# Unconditional Love is Unrealistic
Let's put it this way. We love and we wants to be loved. Unconditional love means putting our trust in the other person, that they will love us back just as much. We open our hearts, we show them who we are, and we open up to the possibility of being hurt and exploited. 

So realistically, we should put up certain rules and conditions to protect ourselves. Sometimes these rules are realistic, such as, "I can't love you if you cheat on me", or "I can't love you if you keep abusing me". Again, this is really up to the nuances of the relationship, it depends on what are considered the limits. And whether this limit actually makes sense. It's simply unreasonable to say that "If you can't stop crying, do not be my kid", or "If you don't give me your finances, you don't love me and we shouldn't be together". To some extent, things can become manipulative. Regardless, every form of human love involves conditions, whether it be to protect us, or our ego over others.

And yes, it is unrealistic in every way. It works only in a perfect world, an unrealistic world that isn't yet tangible to us. This precisely is why only God is capable of it. Because He can do things that are deemed unrealistic or impossible. For God's sake, he could make anything be the reality.

# Trust - When It goes Wrong
When things go wrong, we want to give that person another chance. And maybe another chance. Everyone has a limit to it, and those who are more dependent would be more likely to give their abusers more chances, generally speaking. Frankly speaking, anyone would advise a victim to just stop giving their abuser chances to change. But then, it beckons the question if the victim is truly the victim? Or if it's somebody with a victim complex who finds fault in everything else even if their partner is the most reasonable person in the world? Context. Context. Context.

Even in the words we say, as clear as it is, it still can be taken outside of context. Even the righteous words can be used to manipulate others when applied to a false context. Even God's words. Dare I say that even human communication is flawed. But I imagine that He would know of a way for us to communicate without misunderstanding any things, because God is perfect. I think He has the authority to gift us with that kind of understanding. 

Back to the argument. Humans sinned against God. But if our neighbor sinned against us, at some point we have to distance ourselves and say that "this isn't working out anymore". But God still love us while we sinned and gave up Jesus for us. This is a testament to the way that God loves us regardless of what we did. Perhaps the word "endure" is not quite accurate, but most relatable. We can't endure an insufferable person forever, but God has been endlessly patient and "endure" us. But endure has a negative connotation to it in the human language, as it is something that drains your energy away. But God does so without losing His integrity and greatness. Then patient is the better word. 

So, unconditional love requires and endless patient, a kind of endless love. And humans are limited. So limited that we cannot be endlessly patient with someone. We may still love them, but perhaps not as perfect as we would love a better version of them. Indeed, in the human society, unconditional love requires trust. And this human version of it does work out sometimes. But God's version of it would not even requires that trust. Because when humans broke the trust between them, they drift apart. A person does not trust the others to be better, and the other does not trust that they will be loved again like before. It requires both parties. But even if we repeatedly disappoint God and "break" his trust, He still love us. And that trust isn't broken, because He still have faith in us. Only our trust in Him becomes broken because we fear that He won't love us again. I suppose the devil wants us to think that way, to distance from God. Still, that fear is very valid, because that's how it is in the human world. But God transcends our understanding, and everything else.
