about how your reality is basically your peception. It doesn't matter what the world actually is, because without knowing it or seeing evidence of it, it is just idea. Even then, any form of evidence is subjected to our own interpretations. But regardless the existence of evidence means the same 'reality' exists for others and not just yourself. That's what being real is defined as.


I could be speaking about the brazil football. But like it's just as surface as anything fictional from a book. Because to me I have never interacted and it remains a concept in your thinking than something interactible. But if I see evidence or photos of Brazil football, I acknowledge that it exists somewhere. And if I go there, I can touch it and interact with it.

In fact anything fictional that you invest yourself in emotionally is just as real, but only to yourself. Although I could be biased due to my vivid imagination. 

Social media bubble. I know is within that bubble. But extend that to our present and not just social media anything within the bubble is "real" and "exist", doesn't mattef if it exist for others. ANd likewise anything outside of the bubbles remain as ideas

Without your brain your reality doesn't even exist for "you" (not in realtion to others in your life). But you still exist for others.

Then, we can change our way of thinkings and by extension, change OUR realities. Not the realities that everyone see and interpret, but OURS.
