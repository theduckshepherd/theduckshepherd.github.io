This is quite a shorter post.

## A. Definition
Let us start with the definition of mercy, from the [Cambridge dictionary][definition]:

A. **(Verb)**: kindness that makes you forgive someone, usually someone that you have authority over OR

B. **(Verb)**: kindness shown toward someone whom you have the right or power to punish

One should remember that all humans are intrinsically equal, and as such by our virtue alone we cannot have authority or power over anyone. For us humans to use it toward each other, it implies unequal power where one believes they have the authority to grant mercy to someone else. None of us have any rights or power over each other to have ‘mercy’ on each other. 

In fact, only God has power over us, and only Him is the Most High. As such only God can have mercy on us, and through this it is a word reserved for the Lord alone. The word 'mercy' in itself can only be used justly from the perspective of someone who is of higher power. As humans, what we can do is to have compassion for each other, nevertheless, it is imperative not to place onself on the pedestal.

## B. Extrapolation
By virtue of our good nature alone, we support each other, that’s really how it should be. Not because of the other person, but because of our goodness that we help others as the principal reasons. It is perhaps better to support others without expectations for returns; in fact, through this method, one may remain more at peace rather than pondering over the lack of responses acceptable to oneself.

Because if by any power we have over others financially, politically, etc. and we deny others of help, then it is simply an abuse of power. And through this, the recipient of such mercy is forever indebted. At least, the one with power (that is a human) would believe that they are owed something.

In **Letter to His Father**, Franz Kafka once said.

> "If he really is really hanged, then he's dead and it's all over. But if he has to go through all the preliminaries to being hanged and only when the noose is dangling before his face is told of his reprieve, then he may suffer from it all his life long. **Besides, from so many occasions when I had, as you clearly showed you thought, deserved to be beaten, when you were, gracious enough to let me off at the last moment, here again, what accumulated was only a huge sense of guilt. On every side I was to blame, I was in debt to you.**"

In layman's terms, Kafka’s father could be said to have had mercy on Kafka despite showing every intention that Kafka deserved to be punished. As a result, Kafka himself accumulated only a sense of guilt, that in every way Kafka was indebted to his father. This in itself could be a moral dilemma.

## C. Conclusion
Therefore, instead of having mercy on each other, let us be compassionate and humble ourselves a little. In no way do helping people put us in a higher position than the helped.
