Simply put, another of my strange posts on absurdism, albeit free will, is a more interesting topic. From Albert Camus, "for the absurd man, it is not a matter of explaining and solving, but of experiencing and describing. Everything begins with lucid indifference."

Perhaps time to take on the difference between existentialism and absurdism. And an odd take on free will, which is vastly irrelevant to human society but relevant as a dissection of words. The study of semantics rather than the idea of free will.

Maybe even this title is misleading.

# A. Determinism 
Death is deterministic. Thus, there is a deterministic outcome. However, the process of getting there is probabilistic. Pray tell, what is the chance that one of us gets hit by a car tomorrow? Anyway, I would rather that not happen. There are too many things I would miss out on. In fact, I might die before humanity invents interstellar space travel or wormholes. 

There is a question over whether what we do is truly free will. Is it a chemical process in our cells that will inevitably lead to a certain conclusion, or do we really have a choice? How do we know our chosen action is not already predetermined? That seems to contradict how we see the world, given that we always feel a certain sense of control over our immediate actions. The decision to move your hand a certain way to pick up a cup, for example, It is impressive, is it not? Free will seems to require a consciousness.

What actions can be considered to stem from free will? Most of the time, free will tends to imply that we do as we want, independent of others' influences. Even then, our actions are bounded by our own interests. Free to us, but objectively still shackled, I believe. However, that is the definition of free will as a phrase. Free will must allow for us to be held accountable for our actions. As individual words, "free" in "free will" perhaps means to be independent. Then perhaps a more daring move is to act without being influenced by our own thoughts. Randomness, or perhaps entropy. Regardless of the answer, it loses significance since it is no longer relevant to us.

All living beings have survival instincts. Actions being bound by these instincts, even those lacking conscious thoughts, could it be considered free will too? Perhaps not, for free will requires a "will,"  a conscious thought. But a will cannot be free, for it is bound to whatever it originates from. As two words connected together, "free will" is contradictory because one is trying to attribute the characteristic of freedom to something that cannot be free.

Must this "free will" be able to defy all things to be truly free? Then, it must overcome death and destruction. Then will it qualify as a living being? Because without being a living entity, I can't imagine it having a will.

Either way, this discussion over the semantics of "free will" is somewhat pointless.

# B. Existentialism.
Existentialism considers it an essence for one to create meaning in their life, being aware of the fact that there is no objective meaning. Through that, the creation of meaning becomes a need. The emphasis is placed on the individual being a free and responsible agent. I felt that existentialism displays itself through the act of persistence, continually moving through the absurd. And yet, they seem irrational in that the person becomes compelled to find meaning. Because it is such an essence of the philosophy that it seems a human could not live if, just for a second, their life holds meaning no longer. Perhaps it is presumptuous of me, but such a person, despite claiming the inherent nothingness of the universe, refused to accept or face it. To me, existentialism exists as a form of denial through humans's futile attempts at trying to be a significant part of the universe. 

Whether a person consciously denies it because they would not accept a world of nothingness or if they unconsciously do so because of their inherent attraction towards meanings, it really is all the same. In creating our meaning, we are imposing meanings on the world. For myself, I believe that there is much value in the purity of existence itself. That is, the existence of the universe and its absurdity exactly as they are—nothing more and nothing less. Simply its most undisguised form has much to offer.

Through that, we start to embrace. That is absurdism.

# C. Absurdism
For some reasons, there is a certain charm to absurdism and to what it focuses on. Absurdism focuses simply on embracing the absurd. accepting the truth for what it is and deciding to live it anyway. To live in the truth and to constantly acknowledge the truth is our constant awareness of the absurd in our lives. To live in reality in its purest form, in all its essence. Suddenly, it all becomes more colourful.

Absurdism is just that—the realisation of the absurd. There are no other ideologies attached. But I myself believe that to see the absurd is to also accept and recognise the truth of the universe. Because it is an essential part to stare into the void and acknowledge its existence to realise just how large the gaps between men and everything else are.

Perhaps for myself, I do like living for the truth. For the sake of getting to know the truth about so many things, like an endless pursuit of knowledge, Each person's experiences are different. But eventually, I came to be curious about the absurd and its presence in the world. And even if the philosophical tension tears a person's mind apart, one could not help but be attracted towards that incomprehensible void anyway, like a moth to the flame. 

Absurdism grants freedom to a person in that they no longer belong to the future. That they no longer become bound to some abstract goal or any form of meaning. There is no longer a need to keep chasing after a goal. At the same time, the absurdist is bound by their awareness of the absurd. I dare say men shackle themselves with their own knowledge, for what is learned cannot be unlearned. Even though we stare at the void that is the inherent meaninglessness of the universe and the futility of our actions, we are bound to keep chasing towards that same unfathomable abyss. But we do so with passion. A passion to revolt.

When the world is devoid of any absolutes, of any goals to achieve, or of any deterministic meanings, then we are truly free. This is what it means to not belong to the future. Men are no longer bound by some abstract conceptions, but only by their own knowledge and themselves. And yet Albert Camus never spoke much of free will, since, indeed, it does not matter. Even if we are bound to a nihilistic end, we are free to choose within the limited choices we have. Even the concept of "true freedom" contradicts itself in the sense that any decision must be made from some sort of "vessel" or "consciousness." Then, such things are already bound. Perhaps there is no true free will that can exist, but only the freedom to choose from the cards in our hands.

# D. Finale
It was a pointless discussion, really, over whether we have free will or not. Because in the end, we could not know, and does it even matter? It seems that we can choose what happens now. And as long as it seems like we have some choices, it's already enough. Even if we know we might just be puppets moved by the strings or not, what matters is our own realities. That is how our world is shaped. And as long as, in that world, we have free will, it is enough. Any possible differences could not be distinguished clearly, so why not enjoy it while it lasts? We really are all going to die anyway.
