Here is the question of the day. The possible answers and general understanding are as follows.

<h3>Would you sacrifice a finger for your family, provided that it is the only method to get them back?</h3>

**A. Yes**. Generally speaking, this option presents a virtuous image of the person, given that it is commonly expected that one should honour one's parents.

**B. No**. Depending on the context, this could also be a correct answer. However, in the current society, this is considered a lack of filial piety.

Let us introduce two concepts: our **'True Answer'**, being our honest opinion, and the **'Given Answer'** that we give to others, which may either be a truth or a lie. Our True Answer could either be 'Yes', or 'No', which many people will instead answer 'It depends'. However, on the same logic then for each context, there would either be a positive ('Yes') or negative ('No') answer. 

Note that in this context, because the 'No' answer is considered to be negative and socially unacceptable in many aspects, it is likely that our **'Given Answer'** would be 'Yes', especially if one would want to appear to be virtuous in front of others.

## A. Scene 01: The Question is Asked by an External Individual
Suppose that someone walked up to you and asked you this question, presenting a hypothetical situation. The answers are in fact quite similar to those that are already discussed above. 

To first discuss the psychology behind this regardless of our True Answer, let us assume that a stranger asked us this question. Their motives, perhaps are to simply know how important is our family to us, however, they would possibly not go on to dive deeper. 

Our Given Answer is most likely a yes, perhaps even without hesitation. In some cases, we may be inclined to provide explanations to elaborate on why family is important to us. In the scenario that it is a friend or acquaintance whom we know, we would even be more likely to answer 'Yes' to preserve their opinions of us.

Nevertheless, there is not much pressure in answering this question asked by an external individual, since we would not hesitate to tell the truth (or a lie), since the implications or motive of the questioner is not as heavy, so to speak.

## B. Scene 02: The Question is Asked by a Member of the Same Family
When it is asked by a member of the same family, our Given Answer has a much bigger impact. The questioner is most likely asking not only how important our family is to us, but how important the questioner is to us, as a member of the family. Instantly, we recognised that this question is bound by familial constraints, in that familial relationships could be on the line.

If our Given Answer is 'Yes' (whether it is true or not), the questioner shall be satisfied. If our Given Answer were to show any sort of hesitations that imply a negative response, no matter the words we spoke, then it could imply that one would not sacrifice a finger for their family. Common understanding thus then arrives at the conclusion that a family is not as important as one's finger, despite what the family had done to them.

In this context, both parties are highly conscious of the implications of the question and answer. Note that this would only especially matter to the one being questioned if they do care about their family and their family members' feelings. And because they care, would it not be obvious for the 'Given Answer', and even the 'True Answer', to be a 'Yes'? The problem should have been solved here.

Instead, the obligation for a positive answer from the one being questioned is proportional to the amount of authority that the questioner has over the questionee. Consider this question being asked from a parent to dependent children. The dependent children, being as conscious as they are about their needs, both emotionally and physically, would answer 'Yes', which is also supported by their own genuine affection toward their family. The dependent children could be of any age.

Now consider the question being asked from the same parent to an adult son or daughter who has already grown up and become independent from their parent. At this stage, one can imagine that if the child is truly independent (emotionally, and also physically), they would have more freedom of expression and thoughts. In that, they could freely answer 'Yes', or 'No' clearly based on their opinions of the relationships between themselves and their parents (save for a few other societal constraints).

On another hand, consider the question being asked by a child to an adult in the family. Here, the adults still have more freedom of expression toward their children. Of course, our loving parents would always say that they would do anything for their children. Again, we can't help but recognise that there are also neglectful parents or those who would only give a negative answer. However, this is not our focus here.

Again, this context brings into question not the answer that was to be given, but how much the relationship between the questioner and questionee can influence the answer. The more dependent the questionee is, the more likely they are to answer 'Yes'. Instead, the more independent one is from the other, the closer the Given Answer is to the True Answer.

Of course, there are also different power dynamics at play that could not be simply summarised in this section, and as such this can only mention certain perspectives.

## C. Moral Loophole: Would You Sacrifice X (Any Personally Related Matter) for Your Family?
Let us continue with the context that the questioner was a family member. Note that I have presented this post as a moral dilemma. To be precise, it is closer to a [**False Dilemma**][false-dilemma], defined as:

> The false dilemma fallacy involves presenting a limited number of options as if they were the only options available. This forces people to choose between two extremes, even though there is a spectrum of possibilities in between. The fallacy is misleading and prevents honest debate.

We need not use the example of the finger as the object to be sacrificed. It could be anything material or immaterial to us, as long as it has significance or value to the person being questioned. In the example of the finger, it is not the finger to be lost, but the physical pain to come along with it. The more 'primal' the significance is to the questionee, the more unacceptable it is when it becomes a reason for the questionee to answer 'no'.

In the case of the negative answer, it is easy to come to the conclusion that 'one cannot handle even the pain of losing a finger for his family, meanwhile, his family has sacrificed so much for him. Therefore he is a coward. Likewise,  'one cannot handle the loss of X for his family, and thus he is to be condemned'. The criticisms are especially more severe if the questioner highly values the family as a whole, where prioritising oneself over the family is not generally considered a character of good virtue.

The problems come when the object X in the question becomes something that is immensely large to the questionee that their True Answer is a clear 'No', however out of their moral and familial obligation their Given Answer must be a 'Yes'. If we follow this track, indeed one can get talked into giving up everything about themselves. This is especially more likely when the questionee themselves also highly value their family, which, on its own is a good trait to help. Even though the question sounds wrong when the object X gets larger in value, one still may not be able to recognise that answering 'Yes' may not be the correct solution, nevertheless, it is still the only acceptable answer at the time.

Here I use the example of a family due to the existence of dependent relationships within it. In this case, let us define this dependent relationship as the scenario where the questionee is indebted to the questioner (which, is not yet a bad thing), whereby the questionee has dependency (emotionally or in other aspects) to the questioner. In this case, this moral dilemma can apply to any dependent relationship of this sort. When we are dependent on someone we have a stronger incentive to please them.

Indeed, it is a moral trap that forces the person being questioned to answer 'Yes', especially if the questionee is a 'nice' person, so to speak, who is willing to please those they depend upon. In an ideal society, we should all help others for mutual benefit by our own good virtues, regardless of how they act toward us. This removes the dependency clauses from all relationships, and should, therefore allow all to express themselves freely. In fact, in such a society we would automatically be willing to sacrifice ourselves for others out of our genuine love for others. A positive expression needs not to be forced and should come on its own.

## D. Exploiting the Dilemma
Since this question is such an easy one to figure out what one's expected answer is, it is too easy to exploit it. Someone of a higher position, in the family for example, may simply ask these questions repeatedly to the dependent persons in order to force an obligation on them. And since the dependent persons cannot simply answer negatively, lest they risk losing the relationship, they must answer yes. 

In fact, this 'Yes' answer may possibly come from the dependent persons' love for their family, or at least their desire and attempt to put their family above themselves. This, in itself, is a goodwill. But this only deepens the traps and allows for the same questions to be asked repeatedly, except that the object of exchange (X) becomes even higher, at which point with further exploitations the dependent persons cannot even break free. Furthermore, the questioner would be the one who is most aware of the implications of their questions and the thoughts that run in the questionee's head, which again, gave away hints of a possible abuse of power at play.

At this stage, perhaps the crime does not lie in the questionee's answer, but in the fact that the question was even asked in such an exploitative manner to begin with. Simply exploiting someone's goodwill in order to obtain something, or to put someone under moral shackles is simply heinous. Perhaps I must apologise for my use of words here, but I must also add that I would be deeply disappointed if someone were to use this dilemma in such twisted ways, intentionally (out of negative intentions) or unintentionally (ignorance).

The fallacy lies not in the questionee, but also in the specificity of the object X being asked for in the question. Admittedly, it is common to ask 'Would you do anything for me' as an expression of love (in the context that the questioner would be willing to do the same). This is not wrong in itself because the question is only asked once and not pursued any further.

Likewise, the moral dilemma at play would not be such a problem except it is more often than not asked multiple times, in my experience. Again, if it is just a one-time question, it is simply something we can answer without any fear or obligation at play. Indeed, the dependent, or the questionee, here is in fear of losing the relationship they have with the questioner, and especially in a family this tie is even stronger.

## E. On the Questioner: How One May React
From the questioner's perspective, let us assume the possible reactions. Indeed, the answer to our dilemma in facts also relies largely on the questionee's expectations of the questioner's feelings and reactions in each scenario. Out of moral obligations we seek to achieve the scenario where the questioner is happy by giving the 'correct answer', so to speak.

In the case of a positive answer, the questioner shall be happy about it, that someone loves them greatly to do something risky for their sake. However, one can also imagine that in the case of a negative answer, the questioner may have various thoughts, concerning "I am not as valued or loved as the object being sacrificed.", or "They value me less than something material, despite what I have done for them. They are ungrateful and thus a coward too."

This negative reaction, however, should not have been so escalated to begin with. A positive reaction is to be expected. However, one should be careful with how our feelings of disappointment can lead to anger or resentment. It all came from the expectations to be loved, which, although natural, should not be a cause of sorrow.

As St Teresa of Avila has written in **The Way of Perfection**, Chapter 6 "Return to the Subject of Perfect Love", Paragraph 4:
> Notice, that when we wish for anyone's love it is always for the sake of self-interest or pleasure: those who are perfect, however, have so trodden under-foot all worldly goods, delights, and joys, that even if they wished, as we might say, they could care for nothing outside God and speaking to others about Him; therefore what gain can human love bring them? They cease to care for it, realising this truth so clearly that they laugh at the thought of how anxious they used to be as to whether their affections were returned or not; for pure as our love may be, it is natural to wish for it to be repaid.

I prefer to say that we should trust in the goodwill of the people. Whatever we do to others, do so because it we want to help them, and trust that out of their goodwill, they will help us when we are in need. Even if they don't, it is also fine since we never had any expectations to begin with. As long as one is not actively being exploited, then it should be all good. 

Of course, this way of idealistic life only works in a society where everyone holds the same level, however, it never hurts to be a bit more idealistic ourselves to make the world a bit closer to the perfect image.

If we think of matters this way, then maybe we would not have to feel so guilty about our answers. An answer that came from any kind of obligation, or especially, guilt, is almost disastrous.

## F. Conclusion
I must say that the answer here is still 'it depends', since the question itself may still be asked in a benevolent manner. However, if the question in its exact form is asked as a tool to induce moral obligation, especially with how specific the object of sacrifice is along with the questioner's intent, then our answer should be a clear 'No'. Note that we do not refuse the idea of supporting our family, but we refuse to answer a question that began with a false premise. A false question would not be able to have a correct answer (entropy, perchance).

And furthermore, a question that does not give the questionee freedom of expression should not be asked at all. Not to mention the presented dilemma fit not even for rhetorical purposes.
