Nerd time, so to speak.

## A. Definition, and What Determines What Someone Deserve?
Standard definition from the Cambridge dictionary (verb): to have earned or to be given something because of the way you have behaved or the qualities you have. Note, **because**. This means that for one to deserve something, it is conditional. Fair enough. Let’s make a table.
	
|  | Do Deserve (positive) |	Do not deserve (negative)
|---|---|---|
Do Good things | Morally right | Generally, if the person is bad?
Do Bad things |	Generally, if the person is bad? | Morally right

Almost everyone would agree that people, generally, deserve good things and do not deserve bad things. That is fair. We all agree on that. When do a person deserve bad things, (or do not deserve good things)? When they did something bad (unless you are just being mean). 

An easy example would be a convicted who pleads guilty for a crime he did (let’s establish this as a non-debatable fact in this example). A layperson would say that he deserves his punishment because he did bad things. This is fair in the Court of the Law where (hopefully) everything is fair and he is given a just punishment that is neither too harsh nor too lenient.

But we are humans. Emotional creatures, I would say. It’s simple to imagine the families that are affected by the convicted would be enraged at him, let’s say, for the death of their children or someone they hold dear. That is also fair. However, this is when the word ‘deserve’ becomes subjective. In the context of humans, so to speak, there is in fact nothing to use as a benchmark. 

Let’s say the convicted kill someone’s child. Their families would (probably) want him dead, aka, the convicted deserve capital punishment. Other people might suggest a life sentence, some might suggest an extended period of imprisonment, and some might even suggest that he should be let off because he didn’t mean to kill the child.

Even though the Court of Law could somewhat rightfully determine what he is receiving (which is not really something we interfere in), there’s no benchmark to determine whether someone deserves this much punishment or this many rewards. In an individual capacity, it is subjective. 

Let’s go back to the example of a convicted. In this way, we have noticed people will have differing opinions over whether he deserves his punishment (either too much or too lenient). The Court, however, would most likely not use the word ‘deserve’. Instead, something along the lines of:
•	**The convicted is to be sentenced for [insert punishment] for the following charges [list], according to [sections of the laws]. [Elaborate the behaviours or details in the murder that affected the sentence].**

As we can see, it has a clear basis in the law in terms of what a person who committed certain crimes would be subjected to. The Judge would most likely not say ‘the convicted is sentenced for capital punishment because he deserved it’. As we know, the Judge should be impartial. 

**1. Deserve is not always impartial and can be subjective. In fact, it is a word most likely not used in an objective context where impartiality is prioritised.** Therefore, it is possible to be too harsh or too generous when supposedly giving something that a person supposedly deserves. In fact, this can commonly be seen in society, where people can have biased opinions. That, I believe, is observable.

## B. Question: Do we, intrinsically, deliver what someone deserves?
The Court delivers the sentence, however by no means do they deliver what someone deserves (or not deserve). Sometimes the Court can wrong an innocent who by no means should be in jail. Sometimes the Court’s judgement is too lenient for a raging family member who just wants to send the convicted to the guillotine, Marie Antoinette style.

In fact, the Court simply delivers what was judged to be sufficient. They do not argue over whether he deserves it or not, because on another hand, it is subjective between the judges, in a hypothetically impartial scenario.

Second thing, to deliver something, we must have it in our hands, or if it is immaterial, we must be capable of doing it first.

Let’s say that a person deserves happiness, then we mostly agree that although we do not ‘own’ the person’s happiness in our hands, we do have the capacity to do certain things to make them happy (which, also depends on what the person feel about it). 

On another hand, if someone says a person deserves death, then although we are responsible for our lives it is possible for others to take it away from us if they really try. 

**2. It is possible for us to deliver what we believe someone deserves, depending on the context. In this way, we felt that we at least have certain ‘rights’ to do it, no matter how small. ‘Rights’ to do something ‘Because’ that person did something good/bad, and because we are capable of doing it.**

## C.	Question: Should we really do that?
As previously mentioned, to deliver something we must be, well, obviously, able to do. That is a rather trivial solution (mathematically).
However, do we have the right to do so?

**3. It is (universally) agreed, that we have the right to what we believe we own. And this belief could differ from what a person actually owns.**

Side note: Someone who believes they do not have the rights to something they own could easily let someone else own that something.

Notice that when we deliver what (we believe) someone deserves, we at least feel some right to do it. Or maybe not, but this is a generalisation so it may not apply to everyone.

## D. Analysis
So far, we have made the following statements:
1. **Deserve is not always impartial and can be subjective. In fact, it is a word most likely not used in an objective context where impartiality is prioritised**. Therefore, it is possible to be too harsh or too generous when supposedly giving something that a person supposedly deserves. In fact, this can commonly be seen in society, where people can have biased opinions. That, I believe, is observable.
2. **It is possible for us to deliver what we believe someone deserves because we own that thing, or are capable of doing it, depending on the context.** In this way, we felt that we at least have certain ‘rights’ to do it, no matter how small. ‘Rights’ to do something ‘Because’ that person did something good/bad, and because we are capable of doing it.
3. **It is (universally) agreed, that we have the right to what we believe we own.** And this belief could differ from what a person actually owns. 

From (1) and (2), we can say that it is subjective to say that ‘someone deserves good/bad things because of what they did’, furthermore it is also possible for us to deliver our belief to some extent, especially in certain cases we may felt that we have the rights to do so. Which means:
-	We treat people badly because we think they deserve it.
-	Alternatively, we could treat someone better than others because they did something better, or they are better, or some other good qualities linked to them.
-	Or, we could treat everyone equally well because they intrinsically deserve it (in this case ‘deserve’ should not be used as a word because it is conditional)

From (2) and (3), we can say that we are capable of delivering what (we believe) someone deserves (and maybe felt some right to do it). This could be linked to the fact that we believe we have the rights to what we presumably own.

However, do we really own anything? Intrinsically, not. Everything we have is through the Lord. Which means our argument also breaks.

* **If we do not own anything, we do not have the rights, and thus are not capable of delivering our belief that someone deserves something, the final judgement should be left to the Lord. It is not in our place to feel saddened or happy that someone receives something that may or may not be in line with our opinions about them. In fact, it is probably none of our business to bother ourselves over that.**

(From this perspective, the court of law, as mentioned, does not deliver what a person deserves but what was decided from the written law. It is unrelated to our argument.)

Most importantly, this is not to say that we should never intervene and simply ignore what we see. It is slightly easier to understand that ‘we do not have the right to judge what a person deserves, nor should we act on it because of our belief'.
Note the clause **‘because of our belief’**. And we do know the Prayer for Serenity.

*God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
That should speak for itself.*

## E. Conclusion 
Now, if it is not in our place to judge what someone deserves or act on it, What do we do?

Go back to the definition of the word ‘deserve’: To have earned or to be given something because of the way you have behaved or the qualities you have
Well, why must it be a conditional ‘because of the way you have behaved or the qualities you have’?

We should not be treated simply because of our actions, but because we are humans. That is still conditional (paradoxically), but it is closer to being unconditional.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights says in Article 1:
_All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood._

So, let’s remove the conditional part in the word ‘deserve’. Now we are left with To have earned or to be given something.

That sounds more unconditional. Good. Is there a word that could match it? The word ‘Should’ includes the definition used to show when something is likely or expected.

In conclusion, someone should earn or be given something because they are intrinsically human, and they are born free and equal in dignity and rights. Furthermore, we should act toward one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

This means we should unconditionally be nice to others, not because they deserve something. And because we are born free and equal in dignity and rights, we should not be mean to others. 

By being nice, it means anything with good intentions that contribute to their happiness (roughly), and make them feel joy. By being mean, it means anything with negative intentions to hurt them >:(

It’s better for us to say that someone should be treated nicely, rather than saying that someone deserves to be treated nicely. Anyone, no matter what they do, is still human.

God did tell us to love our neighbour and enemies anyway (Matthew 5:43-48 NIV). He didn’t stutter.
