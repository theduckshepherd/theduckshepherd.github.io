## A. Introduction
We are probably already familiar with the concept of seppuku, as in honour suicide in Japan, which is supposed to preserve honour whereby a person can escape certain shame and guilt. Of course, context is important to anything at all, however here let us focus on the matter of honour suicide purely as a personal choice that is not (or minimally) affected by cultural context. Indeed it is quite a specific case, however, it is better than speaking broadly without consideration.

Predominantly, the shame that is felt can come from various sources, but mostly through having committed immoral or dishonourable actions, not exclusively by oneself but possibly by also one's relatives. In the first case, one commits suicide for repentance of their sins, or else the shame of their sins would overwhelm them. 

In the second case, one commits suicide due to a relative having committed a socially considered heinous action, which tends to stem from the societal judgement that is imposed not only on the relative but their family, including oneself. For example, a parent can feel ashamed that their child became a criminal, and out of despair such a death could happen, in this edge case. Note that this could be influenced by the culture in which one grows up, and if society encourages such a behaviour then those lines of thought are not out of the question.

Regardless, honour suicide, in some ways, involves despair, shame and guilt. Because we are speaking of it as a matter of personal choices unaffected by cultural context (other cases thus would be excluded), honour suicide must be likely to also include reputation, which is more relevant in a social context.

## B. Case 01: Honor Suicide Due to One's Own Action
This case is rather straightforward, due to having committed an immoral action that one contemplates suicide. Such thoughts likely stem from guilt for the crime, so to speak, in addition to the wish to preserve honour. In some cases, it may involve the wish for repentance along with their own perceived hopelessness of seeing a dead end. The emotions involved are rather complex, however, let us divide this into different scenarios, which can also overlap.

- **Suicide from Committing Crime**: More often than not one seeks to repent in an effort to preserve honour, however having seen that there is no way to do so they decided that death is the best option to show that one is remorseful of one's own action. At this stage, it sounded more like a person was simply committing suicide out of guilt, which is in fact a large element in this case. However, in some ways, this method seeks to protect one's good virtue through this supposedly final act of repentance.

- **Suicide from Committing a Dishonourable Action, or Being in a Dishonourable State**: In this case what one has done is not necessarily something immoral or a crime, as long as the act is considered dishonourable by the person (which, more often than not CAN be immoral). A similar situation would be when one is put into a dishonourable situation and thus due to shame one seeks death to preserve their reputation. Regardless, one considers their reputation to be more important than their own life.

In fact, any form of honour suicide would be considering their reputation and honour to be more important than their own life and death. It is said that not because suicide is not scary that people do it, but because their reality is simply even more frightening than the prospect of death.

## C. Case 02: Honor Suicide Due to a Close Relative's Action
In the second case where we discuss honour suicide due to a close relative's action, I must also note that at the time of writing, I'm considering a close relative as a direct family member, as a more direct relation would cause one to feel shame to a greater degree. However, I suppose that any acquaintances who are extremely close to one's heart would also serve as a "close relative" definition in this case. Indeed this is a rather loose placeholder in the argument.

Suppose that one's parent has committed a great sin, and assume that the child feels great shame about this and considers suicide. This scenario, even though extreme, is understandable in that the child feels ashamed to have parents like that. However, the matter is purely not personal, as such it is in fact the direct relation between the child and parent (which is also publicly known), that affects the child's reputation in society. In other words, it can't be helped that there are bound to be bad words regarding not only the parent who committed but also their family, including the grandparents and children. 

The reverse case where the child commits the crime and the parents feel ashamed about it is also true. However, note that in this case, it is reputation and purely honour that is on the line. Back to the previous case where the parent committed the crime, perhaps it is the child's wish to repent on the parent's behalf, or the wish to detach themselves from this relation that they consider suicide, as a way not to preserve their parent's honour but more about the child's own honor. Perhaps also it is a wish from the child to say to the world that "I'm not as bad as my parent, and I'm ashamed of their actions."

However, in this specific case, I must mention family honour too, for there are countries where family honour is prioritised and thus should not be tarnished. In a place where reputation and honor are so important one can only imagine how stressful that is.

## D. On the Matter of Honor, and Encouraged Honor Suicide
Let us define honor. From the [Cambridge dictionary][honor]:

**Noun (Character)**: _a good character, or a reputation for honesty and fair dealing_

Indeed, it is more of a social judgment than anything. However, if we could beg the question of why honour even matters, it seems difficult to devise an answer. As we are naturally social animals reputation is important for the sake of 'survival'. Even in the caveman days, so to speak, it is difficult to be part of a hunter group if one has a reputation of being incompetent and such. Additionally honour, in this case, let it be synonymous with reputation, can fundamentally affect our ego which is often the case that we try to resist.

On the other hand, while reputation and honour are both crucial in the more 'business' settings, even those who are close to us would (hopefully) know that we are not as bad as our actions seem to be. Bad actions were done out of bad characteristics, and likewise, good things happened out of good characteristics. An action does not determine our character as a person so much as it is a manifestation of one of our qualities only. Too often we focused on just that - a few defining qualities - but not the whole person. It is truly unfortunate. As such there are two matters to see through, ego and honour.

On the matter of ego, one should also be aware that one's own action, as bad as it is, does not represent one whole person. Perhaps society is not going to listen for any sort of clarification, however, at least it is hopeful that the person committing the crime and their family know what kinds of person the members all are. Although it could happen, one should hope that not simply because of a crime or a dishonourable action that their family would doubt their character or even contemplate suicide out of shame. Likewise, the wrongdoer should also trust in their own goodness, as we were made to be good by God, and realise that their shame should not be the reason they kill themselves.

As for honour, truly if one is appreciated by one's family, then honour should not have been of much importance. If a wrongdoer already has family and God who knows of their goodness and forgives them, what reasons must they have to kill themselves? The opinions of society, as overwhelming as it is, still came from acquaintances and individuals who knew nothing about the wrongdoer as a person rather than a flat description of an event. Love of God, and of our family should have been enough by itself. St. Teresa of Avila once wrote:

> In this convent you have abandoned and lost the honour of this world, for the poor are not honoured; nor should you honour others at so dear a cost to yourselves. Our honour, sisters, is to serve God; whoever should hinder this had better remain at home with her honour.

Of course, not all of us are joining the monastery. However, truly our only honour is to serve God, and since God gave us enough we should not need anything else at all. Indeed one should still repent and do their penance for what one has done wrong, however in God there is forgiveness, and knowing that I do wonder if a person should be lacking in anything that they would consider honour suicide.

Additionally, St. Teresa also wrote:

> All who aspire after perfection must fly a thousand leagues away from saying, 'I was in the right: it was not right for me to suffer this, they had no right to do such a thing to me!' Now God deliver us from such wrong rights! Do you think that there was any question of rights when our good Jesus suffered the injuries which were so unrighteously inflicted on Him?

Perhaps this line of thought is more common in the families of the sinner who was affected by his/her action. Indeed after having cared for their family for years, it is somewhat unjust that a member now committed a sin that affected not only himself/herself but also the entire family. The family who felt so disappointed and ashamed may even ask themselves "Why is this person my family (child/parent, etc.)?" What they have done is so unacceptable that I can only die, as now society will look upon me and blame me for having raised this person in such a sinful way." Of course, there are only so many ways of thinking that I cannot afford to include them all here, but this is one way of it.

In an extreme scenario, the family members, who now felt ashamed, having contemplated suicide would also harbour hatred and vengeful feelings toward the wrongdoer that they may be encouraged to also kill themselves to repent for their sins. "Since you are the cause of this you too must die, for this is the only way you can repent for your sin and reduce any further damages to this family who have loved you greatly."

In such cases one should attempt to discern the truth, and if one is religious, through prayers. For even our life is not ours but a gift granted from God, and God himself would not be glad that an individual killed themselves due to honour and reputation. Although it is not as bad as pride, it is still not a good way to treat his gift like so. Regardless, I am not one to judge as God is the one who takes into consideration every aspect of the circumstances, and with his understanding perhaps one can still return to God. Either way, it is not my place to claim that those who commit suicide will descend to Hell, for I have no authority to say so. 

In any case, no one should encourage suicide either. Maybe it is more common in societies or cultures that highlight the importance of reputation and honour, especially family honour. Even so, in my biased opinion, family honor should not be something one life or dies for.

## E. Conclusion
Essentially, I only wanted to say that honour suicide, as understandable as it is, is still unreasonable. The object on the line is honor and reputation which should not even be that important to begin with. Even as social standings are crucial matters, there is nothing one can achieve past death, and even though we may feel ashamed, it is better to do actual work to repent rather than take death as a shortcut. As seemingly honourable as the statement "I'm willing to take my life as repentance", the most important thing is still forgiveness in Christ. And if one truly repents, one would still be forgiven and that alone should have been enough for anyone. 

I must admit that as a person who greatly lacks tact, I cannot see any importance in honour and reputation since if there are those who truly understand you, then there is always a place for us. Even if our honour or reputation is rock bottom, there is still a place. Even if on Earth we are all alone then Our Heavenly Father would still love us and understand us most. And since His Love is overwhelming, just that is enough.
