title: "(WIP) Retrospective: Serious Relationship Problems"
category: retrospective
---

This is a personal one for myself. Feel free to skip. More about relationships between people, rather than anything specific like platonic or romantic. I'm too inexperienced for those.

I think it's good to acknowlege, learn, and then move on from situations. It has always been in my nature to accept fact as it is. But I just thought that moving so quickly might not be a good idea, sometimes. It's really hard for me to dislike someone. Or to even dislike their personality. But I always try keeping my respect for them as fellow humans. By the time someone has a serious problem with me, it must have already been beyond salvation, because I always remain neutral and understanding as much as I can. Serious relationship problems only happen when both parties hold different perspectives and stand by it, all the while leading to conflict that both sides don't move out of. I do believe I'm easygoing enough, that I am always up for reconsideration. So if it's a serious problem, then it really is serious and beyond what I could do.

In their perspective, my relationship with them needs fixing. I would have to comply by what they believe I am lacking. But everyone is emotional to their own problems. And as such a neutral person like me will always be seen as "not caring enough". Either way, I move on from things and learn to take lessons from what I experienced. Lessons meaningful to me, not to them. Whatever problems that their relationship with me have, it is reduced to my own issue to reconcile with myself. There's no windows for both sides to discuss when it becomes serious, because it's already beyond everything we could do. There is nothing left to say except for each side to reconcile with themselves. We would end up estranged.

And I do wonder why. Because everything is a learning opportunities that I never really seek for what is rightly mine. No, it's more accurate to say that whatever they have to offer, it's already too late. Already moved on, already learned. Now that I have resolved it within myself, nothing they say could be of significant to me. Perhaps someone owes me an apology, well, it's fine if they don't. If they apologise, it means they acknowledge the problem, and hopefully will not repeat it to someone else. Or because of my philosophy that I am responsible for my own reactions, I took whatever is the problems into myself to learn and sort out my feelings. There's nothing left for them to claim fault for. They could never apologise in a meaningful way, because I'm fine with either.

In that way, I have only resolved my own feelings, and came to the conclusion. But I am clueless as to what emotional needs I have that needed to be fulfilled by others. It feels melancholic, because it's acceptance. Once accepted, it can't be undone. Apologies are just words to me. But I will always remember, and will never really mind it. I thought I could take it, as long as others aren't harmed the same way. 

Is it too cruel that my approaches do not allow for reconciliation? Or perhaps, it's an approach that forced others to reflect. Not because of my stubborness that I refuse to reconcile, but simply because they did not need to even make an effort. The main hurdle is done, and they are left to reconcile with themselves. To reflect, even if it causes guilt or not. Most likely not if it's a serious relationship problem. But if in the rare cases and they do, then it seems that everything become solved in a slightly painful way. Is it because there is no effort needed, that it never feel like any forms of compensation is never enough? If it was me, that would sting. 

And that really is how it works. People apologise to also reconcile with themselves, acknowledging their mistakes. But I have already accepted them before that, and that probably sting more. People wish to be responsible for their acts, but when I just move on so quickly, I took that responsibilities away. Maybe that's why. Taking it that way lessens my burden, since it will only be a matter of reflection. We both move on. I thought it's a happy ending.

But it does feel a bit lonely. In the end, I'm just a human like others. I probably don't have a penchant for romance, but I do appreciate companionship. And it still hurt to realise that when I was wronged, I'm the one who have to handle it all myself. Simply because of my own nature which does not allow me to find any meaning in apologies, instead only a constant process of acknowledgement and learning. Maybe people did apologise to me and make me feel validated, but it's so rare I could not remember anymore. But I do remember which person have asked me how I was doing. It really is significant compared to my own family. 

Maybe I'm just that awkward. Feels a bit lonely when I ended up sort myself out all by myself. It's only natural, because the only case where I have to do it myself is when it can no longer be salvaged. But then, it sounds stupid to take in everything by myself. And sad too. I would appreciate an understanding companion. It just sound like I have to do it because no one else is around.

Or maybe this is a trap I'm putting myself in.

It really is a precious thing to hear parents asking you how your day has been going. Siblings work, but parents are different. One of them don't really ask, since we are on bad terms with each other. And that person believes I'm only here because of their mercy, letting me be here. Because they think I'm lesser, I'm not worth understanding. They don't care. In the end, I have to do it myself.

It's sad being misunderstood, is it not. But since I already accept it, I could no longer pull back on it. How unfortunate. But it is something I'll probably never change. Doing this means trusting others to act the same as I do. Trusting that someone would understand. And that was one of my visions for an ideal world. That we can trust in each other's kindness. It hurts only because the world is not ideal. But one person is better than none. Maybe out of a ton of people out there, one will see the difference and treat me in a similar manner.

Well, I already have understanding friends. So it's not all that bad. Everyone is just flawed, so I can be understanding for both my family and everyone else. That really just brings back to the original problem, doesn't it. How absurd.
